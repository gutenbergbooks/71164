<h3>
CHAPTER I
</h3>

<p>
It is Lauraine Douglas' wedding-day.
</p>

<p>
A delicious gleam of sunshine streams through the
curtained windows&mdash;flickers over the dainty arrangements
of the toilet-table, loses itself in the white wonders
of lace, linen, and embroidery strewed about in different
directions, and finally wanders to a dusky head on the
pillows, and plays at hide and seek over the closed
eyelids of a very lovely face.
</p>

<p>
The eyelids open&mdash;quite suddenly, quite wakefully&mdash;not
with any half-and-half preparation&mdash;any symptom
of sleepiness.
</p>

<p>
The inquisitive sunbeam has done its work, and
retreats bashfully now as two white arms are thrown
suddenly up and placed beneath the girl's head, and resting
thus she takes a survey of the mysterious garments, the
pretty room, the aspect of the weather, as promised by
the wealth of prodigal sunlight, and, finally, the clock
on the opposite chimney-piece.
</p>

<p>
"My wedding-day!"&mdash;so ran her thoughts.
</p>

<p>
"Only a few hours more and I am Lauraine Douglas
no longer!  Only a few hours and the old life and the
things of it are done and past for ever&mdash;for ever.  How
strange it seems to think of that now! ... My
wedding-day! ... How different I thought it would be
once.  How different I thought I should feel.  Oh,
Keith!  Keith! what an old, far-away dream that
looks.  I suppose you have long ago forgotten it.  And
yet how we loved each other ... you and I!  A
boy-and-girl fancy, my mother calls it.  Well, perhaps, it
was; it is long enough since I heard from him, and I
suppose he has long forgotten me.  I wonder if he has
made the fortune he spoke of yet?  But what on earth
makes me think of these things to-day, of all days? ... And
so it really is my wedding-day at last!  I wonder
how most girls feel on their wedding-day!  I can't say I
feel in any way different&mdash;no stir, or flutter, or
anticipation of any description.  I am glad it is going to be
fine, and how nice to be able to wear <i>real</i> orange
blossoms!  Sir Francis was very good to send them.  I
wonder if I shall ever think of him and call him anything
but <i>Sir</i> Francis.  Somehow I never can.  I wish he was
not so old&mdash;old, at least, for me, and I wish he did not
love me in quite such a fierce, wild fashion.  I seem to
have been quite swept off my feet by the current of his
passion and my mother's persuasions....  After all, I
suppose one must be married some time or other
... only&mdash;only&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She breaks off with a sudden sigh, and sits up in the
bed, pushing off the thick, dusky hair from her brows
with an impatient gesture.
</p>

<p>
"It is no use deceiving myself.  I am going to be
married and I <i>hate</i> the thought, and how I have been
dragged into it I scarcely know.  Sometimes I think I
should never have yielded....  How oddly one drifts
into things! ... And Sir Francis is so infatuated, and
it seemed no use saying 'No.'  I wish he were not so
jealous.  I can't understand the feeling myself.  I
wonder what it's like?  Not pleasant by any means, if I
am to judge by my future lord and master.  Will he be
my master, I wonder?  How I should hate to be ordered
about, and kept in check, and ruled!  Mamma is bad
enough, in all conscience; but, still, I have managed to
get my own way with her, pretty often.  How she has
badgered me about this marriage, and what a desperate
hurry they have been in to get it off!  Heigho! only a
month since I bartered my liberty for&mdash;for&mdash;ahem!&mdash;shall
I go over all 'the good gifts that crown me queen'
of this much-sought-after baronet?  Unencumbered
estates, magnificent income, ancient family&mdash;pooh! how
sickening it is!  After all, what do I care for these
things?  One comfort is, I go to him heart-whole.  No
sentiments in the background, no lovers to moan and
fret over.  I wonder if I am really cold-hearted, or if I
never shall fall in love?  Gracious! what am I saying?
That folly must be over after 11.30 to-day.  I suppose
the nearest approach to it was that boy-and-girl romance
with Keith.  Poor old Keith!  What a nice boy he
was, and what a dare-devil, impetuous, headstrong sort
of fellow!  No milk-and-water lover he&mdash;a regular
torrent of impetuosity, bearing one along, whether one
would or no.  I suppose he has forgotten me though, and
no wonder.  How rude mamma was to him, and how
delighted when he turned his back on the Old World
and went off to the New!  I suppose if I ever see him
again he will be a regular Yankee, and talk like that
dreadful woman, Mrs. Bradshaw B. Woollffe, as she calls
herself.  And she will be at the breakfast, after all!
Mamma <i>would</i> ask her.  Heavens! how she does worship
money! But I suppose that comes of having had so
little all her life."
</p>

<p>
A little sleepy yawn comes in here, then the pretty
head turns away from the sunlight, and nestles itself
among the pillows again.  But it is no use to woo sleep
any longer.  The eyes remain open, and the brain is
busy with thoughts, until at eight o'clock a knock at the
door is followed by the entrance of a maid, with hot
water and letters.  The girl sits up and stretches out
her hands for the latter&mdash;just two.  She holds them a
moment, and looks hesitatingly at the superscription.
</p>

<p>
"The last time I shall see that name," she murmurs,
half aloud, as she reads the "Miss Douglas" that has
been her nomenclature for twenty years of her life.
"Heigho! it makes me sad to think of it, after all....
Yes, Jane, draw up the blind.  A fine morning?  Well,
of course, I can see that.  No, I don't want anything
more.  You can go till I ring."
</p>

<p>
Left alone, she opens the letters.  The first is
apparently of little interest, and is tossed carelessly aside.
The second&mdash;at the first line she starts and flushes as
red as a June rose; then with eager eyes reads on with
devouring speed till the end.  It is not a very long letter,
but it seems to agitate her in no small degree.
</p>

<p>
"How strange!" she says.  "After all these years&mdash;and
to-day, of all days!  What on earth am I to do?"
</p>

<p>
She grows very white, and for some moments leans
back on the snowy pillows, with her breath coming
fitfully and unevenly, and her eyes looking sad and
troubled.  Then with a great effort she rises and puts
the letter aside, and proceeds with her morning toilette.
</p>

<p>
She is standing before the mirror in a loose white
dressing-gown, her long rich hair hanging loosely about
her, when the door opens and a lady enters.
</p>

<p>
A very handsome, stately lady, with sufficient likeness
to the girl to suggest their relationship; but the soft
curved lips of the young face are thin and cold in the
older one, and the eyes, though brilliant, still lack the
softness and tenderness that give so great a charm to
those of Lauraine.
</p>

<p>
"Up and dressed, my darling!" she says, in clear,
sweet tones.  Then she comes near to the girl and kisses
her effusively on both cheeks.  "Will you come to my
boudoir for breakfast?" she continues.  "I made
Henriette dress my hair first, so that you can have all her
attention afterwards.  What a barbarous custom to have
weddings so early in the day!  You look very well,
dear; just a trifle pale, but that is quite correct for a
bride."  Then she kisses her again, and Lauraine
submits to the caresses with a sort of passive contempt.
There is no gladness on her face, nor in her eyes, and
she has certainly grown very pale, but the pallor only
makes the beautiful eyes more wistful, and the sweet
red lips more exquisite in contrast.
</p>

<p>
The girl is tall and slender, with delicately-cut
features, and a wealth of dusky gold-brown hair, and a clear,
creamy skin, that shows every trace of the coursing
blood as it flows beneath.  It warms suddenly now,
with a brilliant flush, as she meets her mother's eyes and
listens to her words.  The white slender hand moves to
the toilet-table, and takes from amidst its glittering
array a letter lying there.
</p>

<p>
"Mother," she says suddenly, "whom do you think I
have heard from this morning?  An old friend of ours."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Douglas looks a little startled just for a moment.
Then she smiles sweetly.
</p>

<p>
"I am a bad hand at guessing, love.  Pray tell me,
if it is of any importance."
</p>

<p>
Lauraine looks full at her, still holding the letter in
her hand.  "It is from&mdash;Keith," she says calmly.
</p>

<p>
"From Mr. Athelstone!" remarks Mrs. Douglas
calmly, but a little nervous agitation is visible on her
face.  "Dear me!  I thought he had long forgotten us!"
</p>

<p>
"So did I," answers Lauraine, glancing for an instant
at the superscription.
</p>

<p>
"But he has not.  You never told me that he had
written to you, mamma, three months ago."
</p>

<p>
"To me!  Did he really?" and Mrs. Douglas colours
ever so little.  "I forgot all about it.  Yes, now you
mention it, he did write me&mdash;some nonsense about his
prospects, and how they were improving.  Nothing to
interest me, or you either.  I think you were away."
</p>

<p>
"I was not away at the time," says Lauraine quietly;
"and any news from Keith would have interested me.
But I suppose you thought it best to&mdash;forget."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Douglas looks slightly uncomfortable.  "Dear
me, Lauraine," she says pettishly, "what are you making
such a fuss for?  Keith was a very nice boy, and all
that; but you are both grown up now, and that
brother-and-sister business couldn't go on for ever.  What does
he say in that letter?  Is he still in Chicago?"
</p>

<p>
"He is in England," answers Lauraine, still very
quietly; "and he has been left an immense fortune by
some rich, eccentric old Yankee, who took a great
fancy to him.  Also, he is coming here this morning to call
on us.  He is anxious to see me after four years' absence."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Douglas turns suddenly very white.  Her eyes
flash their eager scrutiny at her daughter's face.
</p>

<p>
"What nonsense!  Here&mdash;and to-day?  It is
impossible.  I must send a message."
</p>

<p>
"Stay, mother."  The girl lays her hand on her
mother's arm, and her voice trembles a little.  "Don't
send any message.  Let him come.  He will be here
just when we come back from the church.
</p>

<p>
"I should like to see my old playmate, and receive
his congratulations on such a day as this.  We were
always like brother and sister, you know.  He will be
delighted with my future prospects, I am sure&mdash;though I
feel rather like the servants who leave an old place 'to
better themselves,' and are not quite sure how they will
get on in the new.  Oh, do let him come!  It is just
the one thing wanting to make my wedding perfect."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Douglas looks at her with puzzled wonder.  "I
don't quite understand you," she says uncomfortably.
"You really wish Keith Athelstone to come here,
knowing nothing of the altered circumstances?  It will
be horribly unpleasant.  There will be a scene, and you
know I detest scenes.  They are such bad form."
</p>

<p>
"There will be no scene," Lauraine says very quietly.
"I think you know me better than that.  And it is the
last thing I ask of you, before I leave your house to-day.
Let him come."
</p>

<p>
She speaks calmly enough, but a feverish flush glows
in her cheek, and her eyes look up at her mother's face
more in command than in entreaty.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! if you put it like that," Mrs. Douglas says,
with a pretty pretence of feeling that Lauraine regards
with scornful amusement, "I cannot deny you.  Let it
be so, then.  I only hope he will behave himself.  He
was always so dreadfully impetuous and hot-headed.
That Spanish mother of his is to blame for that.  Well,
my darling, it is a charming day for your wedding, and
if you are ready for breakfast come down to my boudoir.
You will find me there.  By the way, would you mind
giving me that letter to read?  I should like to see what
he says."
</p>

<p>
Lauraine hands it to her, and an odd little smile comes
over her lips.
</p>

<p>
"If we had not been <i>quite</i> so much like brother and
sister," she says, "and if you hadn't been quite so
determined to marry me this season, Keith would have been a
pretty good match after all."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Douglas gives her a sharp glance of scrutiny.
"You are not foolish enough to regret this boy," she
says.  "He could never be such a match as Sir Francis."
</p>

<p>
"Regret!  Why should I regret?" says the girl,
turning away with a shrug of her pretty shoulders.
"Regret and I parted company long ago."
</p>

<p>
And Mrs. Douglas leaves the room comforted, even
if a little puzzled by her daughter's odd conduct.
</p>

<p>
"Lauraine was always extraordinary," she says,
seating herself in her boudoir to commence the perusal
of this unwelcome letter.  "How thankful I am that I
have secured so excellent a future for her!  I really
thought, at one time I could do nothing with her.  She
is so very odd in some things.  However, Sir Francis will
have to manage her now; she's off my hands, thank
goodness!  It is a pity he is such a brute; but then he
is such a good match, and I am so fearfully in debt.  How
on earth I am to pay for the trousseau I don't know;
and nowadays it's not every man who will take a girl
without a penny."
</p>

<p>
Then she gives a sigh of relief, and takes her chocolate
from Henriette, and settles herself comfortably in her
chair to the perusal of this inopportune letter.  As she
reads it her brow clouds.  She throws it down at last
with an angry exclamation.  "How horribly unfortunate
it should have come to-day!  Still, it's a mercy it
did not come sooner.  What a worry this boy has always
been to me!  First left to my husband's guardianship,
and by his death to mine; then all that nonsense with
Lauraine years ago, and the trouble I had to stop it;
and now he turns up rich and independent, and, I
suppose, in love still, though he doesn't say that.  What on
earth will he say about my keeping back that letter three
months ago?  But it was such nonsense, and it would
have spoiled my scheme entirely.  I hope to goodness
Lauraine has forgotten him; she seemed to take it very
quietly.  Only when they meet it will really be very
awkward.  Dear me!  I shall need all my self-possession
to prevent an <i>esclandre</i>.  I must try and see him first and
alone.  I suppose he has learnt to control himself a little
by this time.  Poor boy! after all he was very nice; and
what a handsome face&mdash;and those eyes!  They would
coax anything out of one, really.  'Bad blue eyes,'
his old nurse used to call them.  Poor old thing! she will
go out of her mind with delight at the bare thought of
seeing him again.  I had better send Lauraine to tell her.
Ah! here she comes."
</p>

<p>
Lauraine enters, paler than ever, and her mother
glances somewhat anxiously at the pretty, daintily-spread
breakfast-table.  Certainly the poverty Mrs. Douglas
speaks of is not outwardly visible in any of the
appointments or surroundings of the house in Grosvenor Street.
Poverty, according to the ideas of fashionable ladies,
seems an extraordinary compound of selfish desires and
inability to be wildly extravagant.
</p>

<p>
"Here is your letter, dear," she says to Lauraine.
"Really quite a stroke of luck for poor Keith; I am
more than delighted about it.  Perhaps, after all, it is as
well he should come here at once, so after breakfast just
run upstairs and tell old nurse.  She will be overjoyed
at the good news.  And now you really must eat something.
You look very pale, and I want you to be spoken
of as the prettiest bride of the season."
</p>

<p>
Lauraine's lips curl scornfully, but she says nothing,
only in her heart she thinks, "I hope few brides feel
as I do to-day!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II
</h3>

<p>
"Heaven bless you, my bonnie bird," says a trembling
voice.
</p>

<p>
It is an hour and a half later, and Lauraine, in her
shimmering satin robe, and with her bridal wreath
upon her brow, stands before a bent, aged figure,
supporting itself on a crutch, looking with dim and most
loving eyes at the beautiful vision.
</p>

<p>
"Ah," goes on the quavering old voice, "may long
life and happiness be aye yours, my dearie.  It's auld
Nannie will pray for it every day she lives, though she
never thoct to see you mated wi' sic a bridegroom, nor
wearing a face so sad on your ain wedding morn.  Ah! if
Maister Keith were here the day he'd be carrying a sair
heart in his breast, I'm thinking."
</p>

<p>
"Hush, nurse!" said the girl gently.  "I can't stay
a minute.  I've only come to tell you some news.
Master Keith is coming here&mdash;coming to-day; and if he
calls when we are at&mdash;at church, I want you to see him,
and&mdash;and tell him about this.  Will you, nursie?  And
make it as pleasant as you can.  Tell him that I am very
happy ... Oh, nurse!&mdash;nurse!"
</p>

<p>
The brave clear voice gives way, a sob bursts from the
girl, and, regardless of the beautiful dress, the costly
lace, she throws herself at the old woman's feet, and
burying her face in her lap, bursts into tears.
</p>

<p>
"Whist, whist, my lamb!" cries the old woman,
terrified at such unexpected emotion.  "What for are ye
taking on in sic a way?  There, dry your eyes, my
bonnie bairn.  You needn't greet on your wedding-day,
surely; and, oh! if your leddy mither comes and sees
that braw goon all sae crushed and crookit, what will she
be saying?  There, there&mdash;rest ye quiet now.  What is
it ye're greeting for?  Ye tell't me but yester e'en ye
were aye quite content wi' yersel'."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" says the girl, rising to her feet, and dashing
the tears away with a half-ashamed energy,
"perhaps I did; but then, nursie, that was yesterday."
</p>

<p>
"Ye were always a queer bit bairn," says the old
woman, looking proudly and fondly at her beautiful
charge.  "Heaven make yer life gang straight, my
dearie.  My heart misgies me sore for you the day,
though I oughtn't to speak sae despondingly.  Still I
will e'en hope for the best, and pray for ye while there's
aye a breath left in my auld body to do it."
</p>

<p>
"Aye, do," answers the girl softly, as she presses her
fresh young lips to the withered cheek.  "Who knows,
nurse, I may need your prayers yet?"
</p>

<p>
"Dinna ye speak sae sadly, my bairn," says the old
woman.  "Keep up a brave heart, and aye trust in
Providence.  You're a braw bride, my dearie, and maybe
he'll be a gude mon to ye, for didn't he swear to worship
the verra ground ye walk on?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't let us talk of him," answers the girl pettishly.
"I feel quite wicked, nurse, when I think of what I am
doing.  It seems to come home to me so terribly now.
But it's too late to help anything&mdash;too late!"
</p>

<p>
"Dinna say those words; they have a wearyful
sound on your bonnie lips," says the aged woman
tenderly.  "Maybe, it will turn out better than ye think;
and the mistress's heart was just set upon it, you know,
and she was always a masterful woman in her way.
Ay&mdash;ay, my bairn, it's ill to greet o'er spilt milk, and all
the kye in the byrne.  There, now, they'll e'en be calling
you.  Yes, I'll remember about Maister Keith, and he'll
hear it as gently as my auld lips can tell him.  Ye may
trust Nannie for that.  Run ye doon now, my dearie,
and God bless your bonnie face, and give you a' the
happiness He sees fit."
</p>

<p>
There is a hurried embrace, and then the girl takes
up her long, floating train in her left hand, and so goes
out of the room and down the stairs, and enters her own
chamber once more.
</p>

<p>
"What a time you have been!" exclaims her mother
impatiently; "and Henriette is waiting to put on your
veil.  Sit down; the carriage will be here directly."
</p>

<p>
Without a word the girl seats herself before the glass,
and the deft fingers of the French maid fastens the filmy
lace on the beautiful head, and like a transparent cloud
it seems to float over and envelop the lovely figure in its
misty folds.
</p>

<p>
She looks so exquisitely lovely that both mother and
maid hold their breath for one moment, and then murmur
rhapsodies of admiration.  The girl looks quietly at
herself, and says nothing.  She knows she is beautiful;
she has proved it often enough in her three seasons of
London life, but to-day she cares very little about that
beauty, for her heart is troubled and her peace has fled.
If only that letter had not come!
</p>

<p>
Alas! it is too late now for regrets or repentance.
The moments hurry on&mdash;hurry on as if they would drag
her to her doom with flying wings, not creep along
leaden-footed, as her own reluctance would have had
them.  How is it she feels like this now&mdash;now when it
is so useless, so vain?  A few days&mdash;nay, even a few
hours ago, and she was content enough; but there
seems no content possible now, and the nearer the hour
approaches, the greater grows her dread.
</p>

<p>
"One moment, mother," she says, as Mrs. Douglas
turns to leave the room.  "Henriette, you may go."
</p>

<p>
The maid retires, and the girl, her face growing very
white, comes close to her mother again, and lays her hand
on her arm.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Must</i> I go through with it?" she says almost wildly.
"Could I not take back my word&mdash;even now?"
</p>

<p>
"Good heavens! are you mad?" ejaculates Mrs. Douglas.
"Go back at the last moment, and the breakfast
ready, and the carriages waiting, and every one at
the church, and your <i>trousseau</i> not even paid for on
the strength of the credit of this marriage!  My dear
Lauraine, you must be a perfect idiot!"
</p>

<p>
The girl's face grows cold, her hand falls to her side.
"I dare say I am," she says bitterly.  "I feel it now."
</p>

<p>
"Your nerves are shaken&mdash;you are getting hysterical,"
exclaims Mrs. Douglas.  "Of course it is a very trying
time, my dear.  You must have some sal volatile before
you start.  For Heaven's sake don't make a scene in
church, or break down, or do anything ridiculous.  You
always are so odd.  Now, any other girl would be
thinking how she looked and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What a good price those looks had fetched," interrupts
Lauraine sarcastically.  "Yes&mdash;thank goodness,
I have some sense of shame left.  I do not feel proud of
my position to-day, or my part in this heartless barter."
</p>

<p>
"Barter!  What makes you use such absurd
words!" exclaims her mother angrily.  "After all I
have done for you&mdash;after all my sacrifices!"
</p>

<p>
"Hush!" the girl says wearily, "don't let us discuss
that subject now.  I think none of your sacrifices would
look very great before this of mine, if it came to a
question of comparison.  But it is no matter.  Of course you
are right; an <i>esclandre</i> now would be too terrible."
</p>

<p>
She turns coldly away, and takes up the beautiful
bouquet that Sir Francis has sent her an hour ago.  The
smell of the white roses and orange blossoms turns her
faint and sick.  All her life long, she thinks, that
scent will, fill her with just such shuddering horror as she
feels now.  She lets the bouquet fall and clasps her
hands despairingly together.
</p>

<p>
"I did not think it would be so bad as this," she
moans.  "O God! is there no escape?"
</p>

<p>
But in the sunny, luxuriantly appointed chamber all is
silence.  A few minutes after, and down the crimson-carpeted
steps a white and radiant figure floats to the
waiting carriage.
</p>

<p>
"How lovely!  How young!  How beautifully dressed!"
</p>

<p>
These are the murmurs that fall from an admiring
crowd, kept in check by an officious policeman, as they
press around the awning that has sheltered the bride's
passage.  "Lor! if she oughtn't to be happy."
</p>

<p>
Unconscious of the comments, heedless of the observations,
Lauraine is driven off to the fashionable church
where her future husband awaits as sad and reluctant a
bride as ever the martyrdom of Fashion and the
exigencies of Society have sacrificed to the God of Mammon.
</p>

<p>
The bride's carriage has scarcely disappeared round
the corner when a hansom cab dashes up, and is arrested
at the awning.  A young man jumps out, pays the
cabman, and gives a startled glance at the carpeted steps,
the gaping crowd, the unwonted stir and bustle around
the house.  He is not a wedding-guest evidently; there
is nothing very festive about his appearance, but for all
that he passes up the crimson-carpeted steps and into
the hall, and there has an interview with one of the
footmen, who, having received instructions on the
matter, conducts the visitor into a small room at the back
of the house, where sits an old woman with a snowy
mutch on her head, and a stick in her hand by which she
helps herself to rise.
</p>

<p>
"My lad, my dear young maister!" she cries, and he
comes straight up and gives her a hearty kiss and a
boisterous hug.
</p>

<p>
"How are you, Nannie?  Why, you look just the
same as ever, I do declare!  Not a day older.  So you
see I've come back."
</p>

<p>
"And a braw welcome to ye, laddie," says the old
Scotchwoman, looking up at the tall well-built figure
and handsome face, with a world of love and pride and
admiration in her dim and loving eyes.  "Hech, sir,
but it's strong and fine ye look the day, and none the
worse for all the foreign countries where ye've stayed sae
long.  Aye, and it's proud I am to see ye back.  Sit ye
doon, sir&mdash;sit ye doon, and tell me a' the news.  My auld
heart's been just sair for word o' ye this mony a day."
</p>

<p>
"I will tell you about myself by-and-by, Nannie," the
young fellow says impatiently.  "Meanwhile tell me
what's going on here.  Is it a morning party, or a
reception, or some new-fangled social rubbish?  Where's
Lauraine?"
</p>

<p>
"Miss Lauraine is awa' at the kirk," says the old
woman gently.  "Canna ye tell what it's a' aboot,
dearie?"
</p>

<p>
"Church"&mdash;falters the young man.
</p>

<p>
Then the idea flashes across him, his bronzed face
falls, an evil light comes into the blue eyes under the
shade of their long lashes.  "She's not&mdash;not married,
Nannie?"
</p>

<p>
The old woman nods her head and lays her hand gently
on his arm.  "Ay, laddie, wedded this morn.  She bade
me tell ye, with her love, that she was happy; that she
hoped to see ye, her auld friend and playmate&mdash;and
would ye wait here till her return?"
</p>

<p>
"Happy is she?"  His voice is very cold and stern.
His blue eyes flash angrily.  Then a short harsh laugh
escapes his lips.  "Well, I'm glad to hear it, though the
news is unexpected.  Married&mdash;Lorry married!  God!
What a fool I've been!"
</p>

<p>
He gets up and walks over to the window and looks
out, though nothing does he see of the objects on which
he gazes so intently.  "Married!" so run his thoughts;
"and to-day, too!  Couldn't she have waited?  Couldn't
she have told me?  It is three months since I wrote to
her mother, and not a line.  And I&mdash;like an idiot&mdash;taking
silence for consent, and rushing back here as
fast as steam could take me.  Married!  Good Heaven!
I can't believe it.  Lorry, my darling little playmate,
my sweetheart&mdash;the girl who vowed to be true to me
for ever&mdash;married!  Never to be mine&mdash;another man's
wife!  O God!  What am I to do?"
</p>

<p>
He groans aloud at this juncture, and the sympathizing
old woman comes to him and her heart aches for her
nursling's sorrow.  "Dinna take on so," she says; "ye
were but bairns togither; ye could na' tell how ye're
minds would agree in time to come."
</p>

<p>
He turns away from the window, and walks to his
seat and flings himself moodily back.  It is too early to
accept consolation, but he takes refuse in hot anger.
He rails against womankind&mdash;their wiles and ways,
their treachery and fickleness, until poor old Nannie is
bewildered.  His fury vents itself in this manner for
the space of a good half-hour, during which time Nannie
listens and agrees and consoles to the best of her
ability, but with very poor results.
</p>

<p>
Then there comes a stir, a bustle&mdash;the noise of feet&mdash;the
sound of voices.  Nannie sits up erect and listens.
</p>

<p>
"They're coming back," she says.
</p>

<p>
He turns very white again, then looks appealingly at
the old woman.
</p>

<p>
"I can't face them all&mdash;it's impossible," he says.
"But if I could see her alone&mdash;just for five minutes.
Oh, Nannie, manage it for me!  I know you can."
</p>

<p>
"I'll e'en do my best," she says, rising and hobbling
away on her stick, her grey silk gown rustling, her snowy
cap, with its lavender ribbons, carried very erect on her
white head.  "But ye'll nae be cross to the bonnie bairn.
I canna have her frightened and disturbed on sic a day.
Ye'll mind?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes&mdash;yes.  I'll mind!" he says impatiently.
"Only send her here."
</p>

<p>
He never knows if the time is long or short that he
waits&mdash;waits with his heart beating so hard and fast
that he can hear it above all those other sounds without.
Waits in a sort of sullen desperation, knowing that his
pain will be but the fiercer, his anger but the hotter, for
the interview he has demanded.
</p>

<p>
Then there comes a faint rustle of silken skirts, the
door opens, there is a sweet subtle perfume of
orange-flowers and roses, and before him stands the loveliest
vision of womanhood that his eyes have ever rested on.
</p>

<p>
One moment he looks at her, and all his anger melts
away, and an unutterable reproach speaks in his eyes,
that are "bad" blue eyes no longer, but only very sad
and very haunting.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Lauraine!" he says, and his arms go out to
clasp her as in the old sweet days that are gone for ever,
and sobbing wildly, the girl falls upon his breast.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III
</h3>

<p>
A moment, and she remembers!  With flushed cheeks
and tear-wet eyes she wrenches herself away, and looks
up at the face of her old playmate.  "Oh, Keith!"
she says, "I&mdash;I was so glad to see you!"
</p>

<p>
The poor pitiful pretence does not blind him.  He
looks at her sternly.  "Indeed?  And may I ask for
an explanation of your conduct?  I think it is due to
me.  Why have you broken faith?"
</p>

<p>
She turns deadly pale.
</p>

<p>
"We were never really engaged," she stammers,
"and all those years you never wrote, and I thought&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You did <i>not</i>!" he says fiercely.  "You know me
better than that.  I am no saint, but I am no mawkish
lover either, to fly from one woman's feet to another,
and pour out love vows at fancy.  You knew I would
be true, Lauraine, and you&mdash;you have been false."
</p>

<p>
She trembles, and is silent.  He looks at her
longingly&mdash;thirstily, his eyes taking in all the beauty he so well
remembers&mdash;all the changes time has wrought.  It
maddens him to gaze upon her&mdash;to think she is so utterly
lost to him.  He feels there is nothing so cruel, so fierce,
he could not say to her at this moment, if only to inflict
upon her some of the pain, the agony that throbs in his
own heart, and runs riot in his own veins.
</p>

<p>
"You are like all your sex," he says, in a low deep
voice of intense wrath, but a voice that makes her quiver
with the mingled rapture, dread, and fear of its memories.
"Truth and constancy are unknown to you.  Did I
need any sign or word to keep me true?  No.  I said I
loved you, and would love you to my life's end; and
so I shall, God help me!  Oh, child! why have you done
this?"
</p>

<p>
"I was driven to it," says the girl desperately.  "You
cannot understand&mdash;you never would, if I spent hours
in telling you&mdash;how it has all come about.  Oh, how I
hate myself!&mdash;and yet&mdash;&mdash;  Oh, Keith, say you forgive
me!  Let us part friends.  Don't break my heart with
your reproaches.  In the life before me I shall have
misery enough to bear.  Give me some kind word now."
</p>

<p>
"I will not," he says fiercely.  "I would not be
such a hypocrite.  I could almost hate you, only
that I know I love you too much for that yet.  But I
will not be hypocrite enough to say I forgive you, or
wish you well, or any such d&mdash;&mdash;d humbug."
</p>

<p>
"Keith!" bursts from the pale, trembling lips.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I mean it," he goes on more wildly, for her
beauty maddens him, and he is longing with all the
wildest and most passionate longing of his hot-blooded
southern nature to fold that lovely figure in his arms, to rain
kisses on the sweet quivering lips, to call her his&mdash;his
own&mdash;his love, though a hundred laws of right and honour
barred the way.  "I mean it&mdash;and I hope my misery
will haunt your life, brought as it is by your own hand.
To-day you have killed the best part of me.  Whatever
happens in the future lies at your door."
</p>

<p>
"Do not say that," she implores.
</p>

<p>
"I will.  If I go to the dogs you have driven me
there, and you know it.  I have loved you since I was a
boy&mdash;since we played together in our childhood.  I have
been cold to all temptations, to all that would make me
less worthy of you, simply because that love lay like a
charm upon my heart and kept all evil away.  I have
worked and toiled, and now, when Fortune smiles&mdash;when
even your mercenary mother might be content
with my prospects&mdash;I come to claim you and find
you&mdash;married.  By heaven, Lauraine, I could strangle you, as
you stand there with your innocent face looking back to
mine, and fling you dead into the arms of the brute who
has bought you!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh! cease for pity's sake," implored the girl, and
her hands go up to her face and shut out that angry one
before her, with the lightning-flashes of wrath in the blue
eyes, and that agony of soul in every quivering feature.
"If you only knew how sorry I am&mdash;how I pity you&mdash;myself&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Her voice breaks.  For a moment everything is
forgotten&mdash;her strange absence&mdash;her mother's uneasiness&mdash;the
wondering comments of the guests&mdash;of these she
never thinks.  Just for one single moment they stand face
to face, and soul to soul, and see before them the awful
shipwreck of two young despairing lives!
</p>

<p>
"Pity me!  Ah, you well may," cries Keith, softening
a little at the low, tender voice, and the misery on the
young, white face.  "God knows I need it.  Go&mdash;go,
while I have strength to let you.  If you knew what a hell
is in my heart at this present moment, you would wonder
I could bid you leave me now.  It would be easier to kill
you than know I send you back to your&mdash;husband."
</p>

<p>
She shudders as he says those words.  He has turned
away, so that he may not see the fatally fair face&mdash;the
drooping grace of the lovely figure round which the
costly satin falls in gleaming folds.  She moves away;
then looks back.  His head is bent down on his arms&mdash;a
sob shakes the strong young frame.  It goes to her heart
like a knife.  Impulsively she approaches, and lays one
little hand caressingly on his arm.
</p>

<p>
"Dear Keith, don't grieve&mdash;don't fret for me.  You
are right.  I was never worth your love&mdash;never!  I
deserve all the unhappiness that Fate can bring.  But
first say you forgive me this once; I cannot bear to part
in anger from you."
</p>

<p>
Dangerously soft, dangerously sweet is the pretty
voice.  It goes straight to the aching heart to which she
appeals.  With a strong effort he conquers his emotion
and looks up&mdash;how haggard, how altered is the bright
young face she remembers!
</p>

<p>
"I was a brute to say what I did just now," he
exclaims, with rapid contrition.  "I am half-mad with
pain.  Yes, Lorry, I will try and forgive you, though it is
horribly hard.  You are not a man; you don't know&mdash;oh
God! how <i>can</i> I bear it!"
</p>

<p>
She trembles violently as she stands beside him; the
folds of her dress sweep across his feet, the faint, sweet
perfume of the orange-flowers steals over his senses.  He
bows his burning forehead down upon her hands, and for
a moment is silent too.
</p>

<p>
"I <i>must</i> go," whispers the girl desperately, at last.
"Good-bye, Keith&mdash;darling Keith.  For my sake, try
and bear up now; and oh, promise me you won't carry
out your awful threat; you won't go to the&mdash;bad."
</p>

<p>
"I can't promise any such thing," he says, relapsing
into gloom and anger once more.  "You don't know
what you've done to me.  I never was particularly good,
and if I tried to be, it was simply for your sake.  Now
my anchor is gone, and I am cut adrift.  Whatever evil
I do lies at your door, as I said before!"
</p>

<p>
"You are cruel&mdash;cowardly to say that!" she cries
quickly.  "I have not been blameless, but I have not
been false to you in my heart&mdash;that I know, and if you
had only told me, only written&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Your mother made me promise I would hold no
communication with you for four years!" he says
eagerly.  "At the end of that time my prospects
began to brighten.  This Mr. Hezekiah Jefferson took
me up, and then promised to leave me all his fortune.
He was rich as Croesus, and hadn't a relative in the world.
I told her all this, and begged her to tell you.  I had no
answer from either.  Then old Hezekiah died, and I
jumped clear into two million dollars.  I rushed home as
soon as I could put things square, and get here&mdash;just too
late!  Do you expect me to sit down like a tame cat, and
console myself by saying it can't be helped?  I think
you know my nature better than that?"
</p>

<p>
She drew a long, quivering sigh.  "If I had but
known?" she says.
</p>

<p>
"So your mother never told you?  I was a fool to
trust her.  Women don't seem to have more honour
than they have constancy.  But it's no use going over
the old ground.  You are lost to me, and I don't care
two straws what becomes of me now.  There, I see you
are impatient to be off.  Good-bye, don't let me detain
you from your&mdash;husband!"
</p>

<p>
He rises as he speaks, and all the old evil light comes
back to his eyes and his face.  The girl looks sadly,
reproachfully at him; she is white and trembling&mdash;this
scene has tried her terribly.
</p>

<p>
"Shall I&mdash;shall we see you again?" she asks faintly.
</p>

<p>
"No," he says, drawing his brows together in an angry
frown.  "I am not going to intrude myself as a spectator
of your happiness.  I shall take myself off at once."
</p>

<p>
"And will you not be&mdash;friends?  Am I never to see
you?" she says with a foolish longing that he may not
pass utterly out of her life&mdash;a longing she feels to be
wrong, and yet cannot refrain from expressing.
</p>

<p>
A sudden light flashes up into the young man's face,
then fades, and it grows black and thunderous once more.
"If I see you again it will either be a great deal better,
or a great deal&mdash;worse&mdash;for us both," he says huskily.
"You had better not tempt me, Lauraine."
</p>

<p>
A great wave of crimson flushes her face.  Her eyes
sink before the sudden fire and passion that leap up
beneath those dusky lashes of his.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye!" she says again, and holds out her hand.
"We do part&mdash;friends?"
</p>

<p>
He hesitates for a second's space, then a cold, strange
smile comes to his lips.  "Certainly&mdash;the best of
friends, Lady Vavasour."  The door opens as those
mocking words escape his lips.  Before them stands
Mrs. Douglas, her face white and anxious.
</p>

<p>
"I am just coming, mamma," says Lauraine calmly.
"I cannot prevail upon Mr. Athelstone to join us at
breakfast!"
</p>

<p>
"So pleased to see you, my dear Keith!" says Mrs. Douglas
sweetly.  "Only such an unfortunate time for
a visit.  Impossible to hear all your news.  We must
have a long, quiet chat together when all this is over.
Lauraine, my dear, you must really come back to the
drawing-room.  Can't we prevail upon you, Keith?"
</p>

<p>
"No, you can't," says Keith rudely.  "I have been
so long away from fashionable society that I am afraid I
shouldn't get on with your guests.  But I am quite
ready to have a chat with you, Mrs. Douglas, when you
can favour me with your company.  I think we have
something besides news to discuss."
</p>

<p>
"Most happy&mdash;delighted, I'm sure," answers Mrs. Douglas
vaguely.  "I will write and tell you what day,
my dear Keith.  So many engagements just now, you
know."
</p>

<p>
She sails out of the room, with Lauraine beside her.
</p>

<p>
"Really, Keith has become quite American," she says
complainingly.  "So altered&mdash;so quite too coarse, and
all that.  It makes me shudder to hear him speak.  He
will be just like the Bradshaw Woollffes, I suppose.
What a time you were with him, Lauraine&mdash;such bad
form, you know!  However, I am glad he's going.  It
would have been quite unpleasant if he had stayed."
</p>

<p>
Lauraine draws her hand away from her mother's arm,
and looks her steadily in the face.
</p>

<p>
"You are right," she says, "it <i>would</i>."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Douglas feels anything but comfortable as she
meets that cold gaze.  But in her heart she says:
</p>

<p>
"How fortunate that he did not come sooner&mdash;even
yesterday!"
</p>

<p>
She almost shudders as she thinks of the "slip" that
might have been between the costly cup she had been
occupied in raising, and the lips to which it had been
successfully carried.  "All is safe now, though," she
thinks.  "But how thankful I shall be when she is
fairly off.  Was ever such a wedding day as this?"
</p>

<p>
And then she sails into her splendid rooms, and
receives congratulations, and flutters about in graceful
agitation, and feels that if ever a mother deserves the
victor's crown of matrimonial success she deserves it.
</p>

<p>
Of course all danger is over now.  Do not all novels
end with a wedding?  Are not all Society's daughters
considered settled and established once the ring is on, and
the rice and slippers thrown?  Still, as she looks at her
daughter's face, an odd little uncomfortable feeling
thrills her heart.  There is something so strange, so
<i>dead</i>-looking about bright, beautiful Lauraine.
</p>

<p>
But she is married&mdash;safely married now.  What is
there to fear in the future, to regret in the past?  Ay,
<i>what</i>?

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
</h3>

<p>
A cold, wet afternoon in March.  But a few days ago
people believed in spring.  There was abundance of
sunshine, of blue sky, of tender, venturesome birds;
there had been piles of violets and primroses in the
flower-girls' baskets, as they moved about the London
streets; a breath of genuine spring-time in the soft air;
but now all was cold and bleak and drear once more,
and people went back shiveringly to fires and furs, and
abused the treacherous English climate to their hearts'
content.  The external cold and dreariness were shut
out effectually in a house in fashionable Mayfair.
A sort of small drawing-room, opening off the
grandeur and luxury of a larger one; a room with a
hundred costly knick-knacks scattered about, with velvet
draperies, and filled with hothouse flowers, and over
which the fire-gleams played.
</p>

<p>
A silver tea-urn stands hissing on a low table by the
fire&mdash;dainty cups stand beside it.  All is warm, fragrant,
pleasant to the eye and the senses, and a silvery babble
of women's voices adds life to the scene.
</p>

<p>
"What has become of your young friend, Mr. Athelstone?"
asks a pretty, fair woman, as she puts down
her cup, and turns to the presiding goddess of the
ceremonies&mdash;a big, imposing-looking woman, magnificently
dressed.
</p>

<p>
"He's in Rome still," she answers, with a strong
American accent.  "Means to stay there, too, I
surmise&mdash;leastways, until the Vavasours come to town.
Wonderful pretty woman Lady Vavasour&mdash;Lady Lauraine, as
the poetry man calls her.  You know that story?"
</p>

<p>
"No," chime in two or three voices.  "What was it?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, he was an Italian," says the lady, who rejoices
in the name of Mrs. Bradshaw B. Woollffe, "and very
poor, I believe, living in a garret, and that sort, but a
right down poet, so every one says <i>now</i>, and Lady Vavasour
found him out, and had his book published, and it
took like wildfire and of course he's eternal grateful to
her, and he wrote something on her&mdash;called her 'My
Lady Lauraine'&mdash;sounds pretty, don't it&mdash;and the
name was taken up, and in Rome no one called her
anything else.  She was quite the sensation of the day
there; but she <i>is</i> wonderful pretty, and no pumpkins
about <i>that</i>."
</p>

<p>
"She's been married&mdash;let me see&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Two years, just upon.  She's very delicate&mdash;that's
why they went to Rome.  Chest, or lungs, or something.
An almighty pretty baby she's got too, and
don't she seem fond of it!  As a rule, mothers nowadays
don't even bother their heads about their children&mdash;'ceptin'
to dress 'em like dolls, and take 'em out as a
show in their carriages."
</p>

<p>
One or two fashionable mothers present wince a little
at Mrs. Bradshaw B. Woollffe's outspoken opinion, and
feel more than ever convinced that she is dreadfully
vulgar, and really it would be quite impossible to know
her, only she is so amazingly rich.
</p>

<p>
"And she and Mr. Athelstone are great friends, you
say?" questions another voice.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," answers Mrs. Bradshaw B. Woollffe shortly.
"Knew each other as children; brought up as brother
and sister, and all that."
</p>

<p>
"How very charming," simpers an inane-looking
model of fashion, settling her bonnet strings, and wishing
that some men would take it into their heads to drop in
and relieve the monotony of feminine society.  "<i>That</i>
sort of relationship is so free and easy, and no one can
say anything.  But I heard that the Vavasours are
coming back for the season?"
</p>

<p>
"So they are&mdash;at least Keith told me so when he last
wrote.  I knew him in New York," she added explanatorily.
"He is a nice boy; deserves his luck, too.
Uncommon rich, ain't he.  My! two million dollars
ain't bad; and I'm not sure if it ain't more.  Old
Hezekiah Jefferson was a relation of my niece.  He was a
warm man, he was, and this boy's got all."
</p>

<p>
"He ought to marry," suggests a Belgravian matron,
who has two daughters "out," and a third budding into
bloom, and becoming obtrusively anxious to show herself
among the rosebud "garden of girls," who blossom
in the London season.
</p>

<p>
"Marry?"  And Mrs. Bradshaw B. Woollffe laughs.
"I guess he don't think of that yet awhile.  He's too
young, and he likes his liberty; he's a bit skittish, too,
but that's not much account as some go.  Marryin' will
be more than he'll care about for a long time to come,
even though the girls do go after him like squir'ls
after cobs.  But then he's uncommon handsome, too."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps his <i>friend</i>, Lady Lauraine, as you call her,
would object to his settling down?" suggests the
Belgravian matron, with a little more acidity than
sweetness in her well-modulated voice.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Bradshaw B. Woollffe puts down her teacup, and
looks straight at the speaker,
</p>

<p>
"In our country," she remarks, "people say
right down what they think.  I don't know what
you mean, but I guess.  Lady Lauraine is a good
woman and a good wife, and she'd be glad enough to see
her old playfellow settled and happy; but, you see it's
difficult for a rich fellow to know whether it's himself
or his money that the girl takes him for, and I suspect
Keith would like to be sure on that subject before he
jumped into matrimony."
</p>

<p>
There is a momentary hush among the fair tea-drinkers;
but all are agreed in their minds that Americans
have an unpleasantly coarse way of putting things.
</p>

<p>
"It's four years ago since I came to Eu-rope,"
resumed Mrs. Bradshaw B. Woollffe.  "I've got more
spry about your ways than I was.  But there's one
thing I don't hold with, and that is that you don't
believe in your women.  Our Amurcan girls, now, go to
their balls, and parties, and skatin' matches, and
junketings, and the young fellows see them home and 'squire
them about, and we don't think no harm of it; and
as for scandal, why, we'd call a man a blackguard who'd
say a word against a girl's character for goin' about with
another man.  It's a point of honour with <i>them</i> to treat
'em just as respectfully as if a hundred mothers and
chaperons were looking on.  Now, here in Europe
you're all in such a mortal funk, not only with your gals,
but with your married women.  You don't seem to
believe in such a thing as friendship.  Why, if a
man and a woman like to talk to each other there's
a scandal directly!  I surmise it's your way, but it
bothers me, that it does."
</p>

<p>
There is a little titter among the fair worshippers at
the shrine of tea and riches.
</p>

<p>
"Dear Mrs. Woollffe, you do say such odd things;
but I think you quite mistake.  We are certainly
particular with our girls.  We must be.  Society would be
scandalized if they went about in the free-and-easy
fashion of their American cousins.  But with married
women it is quite different.  We are really <i>free</i>&mdash;more
free, I think, than your countrywomen; and as for
<i>friendship</i>&mdash;dear me, that is quite allowable&mdash;quite!"
</p>

<p>
"Of course," chime in several voices in the background,
for all the attention of the conclave is aroused
now.  "But then there are friendships, <i>and</i> friendships."
</p>

<p>
"Exactly," says Mrs. Bradshaw B. Woollffe drily.  "It
is the '<i>and</i>' ones I mean.  How is it you know so well who
may not look at the halter, and who may steal the horse?"
</p>

<p>
"It is&mdash;it is somewhat difficult to explain," hesitates
the pretty fair woman, who has a charming "friendship"
of her own on hand just now, and is anxious it
should be considered as blameless as, of course, it is.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Bradshaw Woollffe laughs loudly.
</p>

<p>
"I surmise it is," she answers, "something like the
people one can't know and the people one can.  I
suppose as long as one's got a pretty big pile, one can do
anything."
</p>

<p>
"But to return to Mr. Athelstone," says Belgravia, a
little uncomfortably.  "Don't you really know when
he'll come back?"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps I do," answers Mrs. Woollffe, with an odd
little smile.  "He's just promised to come and stay with
me the end of the month.  I have a niece&mdash;a very pretty
girl she is, too&mdash;coming over from N' York, and as they
knew each other in Amurca, I thought it would be
company like for them to be together."
</p>

<p>
Horror and consternation fill the heart of the
Belgravian matron.  The prospects of her two daughters
who are "out," and the blushing <i>ingénue</i> in prospective,
flee further and further back into the regions of
disappointment.
</p>

<p>
What an odious woman!  What a horrible woman!
What on earth does she mean?  Oh, if only she were
poor, and if only the Earl of Longleat hadn't taken her
up, how she would crush her now beneath aristocratic
scorn.  But&mdash;well, it never does <i>quite</i> to fall out with so
much money, and lose all the dinners, balls, and
receptions which the wealthy widow gives right royally
in the season.  So the ire is smothered and the frowns
dispelled, and only the sweetest of phrases issue from
lips that are absolutely trembling with hatred and
disgust.  The rooms grow emptier and emptier.  The last
visitor leaves, and Mrs. Bradshaw B. Woollffe leans
back in her most comfortable chair, and laughs softly to
herself in the glow of the firelight.
</p>

<p>
"We don't raise <i>that</i> sort down our way," she says,
"and I'm glad of it.  Well, I think I riled 'em with that
bit about Anastasia, and it's no cram either.  She is
uncommon pretty, and ought to take.  I shouldn't mind
getting a bid for her, only she's that sweet on Keith I'm
afraid it won't be easy.  But he don't care a red herring
for her&mdash;<i>that</i> I know.  I wonder what's become of the girl
he told me of in N' York that fall.  He ain't married
her, and when I asked him why, he cut up mighty rough,
and as good as told me to mind my own business.  But I
like that Keith.  I wish he seemed a bit happier, that I
do.  He's not near so spry and lively as he used to be.
How all these women are after him!  Guess I got a rise
out of them <i>that</i> time.  My, if they knew he was coming
here to-night!  'Taint none of their business though, and
I don't mean it to be.  I think I'll keep the dragons off
him better'n most.  I and&mdash;Anastasia!"
</p>

<p>
And she laughs again, a pleasant, cheery laugh, not with
any insincere modulation or false ring like the laugh of
Society.  But with all her vulgarities and eccentricities,
Mrs. Bradshaw B. Woollffe is a genuine woman.
</p>

<p>
She pours herself out another cup of tea, and looks
complacently round her pretty room; and as she looks,
there comes the sound of a step on the stairs, and the
door is thrown open, and a tall figure comes
straight to her amidst the obscurity, and she springs up
to welcome him with a cordiality so genuine that Society
would doubtless call it vulgar.
</p>

<p>
"Keith, my dear boy&mdash;so you've come.  I'm <i>real</i> glad
to see you, that I am."
</p>

<p>
Her visitor takes the two hands she extends him, and
returns their warm pressure.  Then she forces him into a
chair by the fire, and stirs the logs into a blaze, and
brings him some tea, and fusses about him in a pleasant,
genial, womanly fashion that is all her own.
</p>

<p>
Keith Athelstone accepts her attentions with laughing
opposition against the amount of trouble she is taking;
but on the whole he likes it, and he likes her too, for she
has been a kind friend to him in days gone by, when he
was only poor and struggling&mdash;a stranger in a strange
land, not yet having "struck ile" in the way of fortune
and success.
</p>

<p>
"And so you have really left Rome?" says Mrs. Bradshaw
B. Woollffe at last, when her guest is reclining
lazily in his chair, and has begged her not to ring for
lights or disturb the cosy solitude of the room.  "And
how are the Vavasours?"
</p>

<p>
A little change is visible in the face of the young man&mdash;a
face strangely altered in these two years.  The features
are handsome as ever, but there is a haggard, worn look
about them, and the blue eyes are feverish and dim,
and heavy shadows lie beneath the long dark lashes.
</p>

<p>
Those eyes and lashes are the greatest beauty in Keith
Athelstone's face, and now that haunting look of sadness
gives them tenfold more attraction than they possessed
before.  "They are quite well," he says, after a brief
pause; "they come to town next week."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder you did not wait and come with them."
</p>

<p>
"Lady Vavasour did not wish it," he answers quietly.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Woollffe gives him a quick glance and is silent.
</p>

<p>
"I've had a troop of women here," she says presently.
"Glad you didn't come in the midst of their chatter.
My, they'll be after you like flies after molasses this
season, Keith!  Take care you aren't married in
spite of yourself."
</p>

<p>
"Married?" his voice rings out with angry energy;
"not if I know it.  I <i>hate</i> women."
</p>

<p>
"Hate 'em?&mdash;that's queer," remarks Mrs. Bradshaw
B. Woollffe.  "Something's wrong with you, then.
Boys at your age aren't women-haters for nothing."
</p>

<p>
"I mean, of course, those husband-hunting creatures,"
says Keith apologetically.  "Why can't they let a
fellow alone, I wonder?"
</p>

<p>
"Can't say, I'm sure, unless it's just their malice
drives 'em on one against the other, and each tries to be
foremost with the traps and gins.  When a man's got
money, I suppose they think it ain't right unless he
shares it with a female.  And there's such an almighty
lot of women in Great Britain.  Nice enough, too, some
of 'em; I like 'em better'n Amurcans.  They've a
real good time of it out here, too.  When we get married,
we're shelved&mdash;done for.  We let the young 'uns have
their time; but, lor' bless me, <i>here</i> the married women
seem to have the best of the fun, and are as skittish as
colts, even when they're forty."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, that's so," answered Keith.  "In these days
married women&mdash;so long as they're pretty&mdash;command
more admiration and attention than the girls.  The
fact of being appropriated seems to lend them a greater
charm.  Perhaps, though, men think they're safer.
The mothers make such dead running, you know, and if
you dance twice with a girl, suspect 'intentions.'"
</p>

<p>
"It's bad, though," says Mrs. Woollffe, shaking her
head.  "Bad for Society&mdash;bad for men&mdash;bad for the
girls, too.  They'll marry the first man who asks them,
because they think they'll have more real freedom
afterwards.  But what sort of wives and mothers will
they make?"
</p>

<p>
"Those are secondary points of consideration"&mdash;sneers
Keith, and his face looks hard and almost cruel
now, as the flames leap up and frame it in their sudden
brightness.  "Old-fashioned ideas like truth and
constancy, and all that."
</p>

<p>
"Come, I can't have you getting cynical," says his
friend good-humouredly.  "You're too young, and I
hate to hear young fellows like yourself railing against
women.  It don't seem right, somehow.  What do you
know of them?  They're mighty queer creatures, and
would puzzle the wisest man; but all the same, they're
not all downright bad, and you mustn't judge the whole
bale from a poor sample."
</p>

<p>
Keith says nothing.  His eyes go back to the fire,
and a cloud darkens his brow.  He knows in his own
heart that he hates all women, only because he loves
one&mdash;too well.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V
</h3>

<p>
In the dressing-room of her Park Lane mansion a woman
stands dressed for the evening.
</p>

<p>
Her face is lovely, her toilet exquisite, a rain of
diamonds seems to glitter about her; but there is no
gladness in the eyes that gaze at their own reflection,
and an unnatural gravity and sadness seem to sit on
the white brow and round the soft young lips.
</p>

<p>
It is the face of Lauraine&mdash;Lady Vavasour.
</p>

<p>
A maid enters with a bouquet and a note, and gives
them to her.  "Sir Francis desired me to say he was
waiting, my lady," she says respectfully.
</p>

<p>
"I will be down immediately.  You can take my
cloak," answers her mistress.
</p>

<p>
The maid leaves the room, and Laura opens the note
and reads the few lines it contains.  Her face does not
change except to grow even sadder for a moment.
Then she tears up the letter, and taking the flowers in
her hand, sweeps slowly away.  She moves across the
richly carpeted corridor, and enters another room facing
her own.  It is dimly lighted, and all its draperies are
pure white, and the furniture of satinwood.  In one
corner stands a little cot, the lace curtains looped back
with pale azure ribbons.  A woman rises at her entrance,
and stands up respectfully.  Lauraine passes her, and
goes over to the little bed and looks down with eyes full
of love unutterable at its inmate.
</p>

<p>
A child lies there asleep.  Soft, dusky rings of hair curl
round the broad, white brow&mdash;the cheeks are flushed
like a rose&mdash;the tiny scarlet mouth is half open&mdash;the
little hands lie outside the snowy coverlet.  Lauraine's
face grows transfigured as she looks on that baby form;
such love&mdash;such rapture&mdash;such pure, holy, exquisite
joy irradiates it!  She stoops down and presses her lips
to the baby brow&mdash;takes one long, idolizing look at the
cherubic loveliness that is her dearest earthly treasure,
and then whispers some parting injunctions to the
nurse and leaves the room.
</p>

<p>
"How long you have been!  What a deuce of a time
you women do take to put your gowns on," grumbles
her husband, as he meets her at the bottom of the stairs.
"The horses have been standing out there in the cold
for more than half an hour."
</p>

<p>
Lauraine makes a sign to her maid to put on her wraps,
and then follows her husband out to the carriage.  He
has not looked at her&mdash;he has not noticed one detail
of the exquisite toilette&mdash;his voice in addressing her is
harsh and impatient, and they have been married but
two years.  Yet the coldness and indifference she now
receives is ten thousand times preferable, she thinks,
to the frantic passion that he had once bestowed.  He
had been mad to have her, and he had won her!  Now&mdash;well,
now that infatuation looked as absurd as it had
once been imperative.  It is a man's nature; it always
has been and always will be so.
</p>

<p>
Lauraine too feels strangely changed.  She seems to
have grown cold, hard, indifferent to everything.  These
two years seem like ten.  This is her first season in
London since she married, and she looks upon it as a
duty enforced, and with not one throb of pleasure or
anticipation.  She is young, rich, and very lovely; but
she carries a heavy heart within that beautiful bosom,
and knows that the one great error of her life is ever
demanding compensation.
</p>

<p>
Six months ago she and Keith Athelstone met again.
He had gone back to New York after her marriage, to
settle his affairs, and for eighteen months she had
neither seen nor heard anything of him.  When they
met in Rome she had been startled and afraid of the
change wrought in so brief a time.  He looked years
older.  The bright, genial, sunny temper that had given
him so great a charm was now sullen, uncertain, and
bitter.  He was restless, extravagant, and capricious.
Much that she had heard of him pained and annoyed
her deeply; but she scarcely dared remonstrate for fear
of being met with a sneer or a reproach.  Her husband
took an unaccountable fancy to the young fellow, and
had him constantly at their house; but it frightened
Lauraine to see the hatred and contempt that at times
flashed out in Keith's eyes and voice against the
man who called him friend.  No word of the past&mdash;no
allusion to that wedding-morning of hers&mdash;ever
passed between the young man and herself.  She
almost hoped he had forgotten his boyish passion&mdash;would
be content to accept the friendship she had once
proffered him, and he had rejected so scornfully.
</p>

<p>
For herself nothing seemed to signify much now.  The
whole tenderness of her nature spent itself on her child.
</p>

<p>
If she could have had her way, she would have liked
to live in the quiet old Northumbrian house which was
her husband's, and there given herself exclusively up to
the care and teaching of her boy.  But such a wild idea,
was of course, scouted and ridiculed.
</p>

<p>
Her husband was proud of her in a way&mdash;proud of
the sparkling beauty, the dainty grace, the mind and
manners of the woman he had made his wife.  She
would never be fast or vulgar, or think only of conquests
and admiration, and drag his name through the mire of
scandal.  No; she would always be <i>safe</i>&mdash;that he felt, and
if he had grown tired of her he was determined that the
world should see and admire her, and applaud his choice.
It would gratify his vanity, just as it had done in Rome,
where she had been courted and worshipped and eulogized
everywhere as "Lady Lauraine."
</p>

<p>
The carriage rolls smoothly and swiftly on.  Lauraine
leans back, with her eyes gazing dreamily out at the
lighted streets.  Her husband breaks the silence at last.
</p>

<p>
"I want you to be specially civil to Lady Jean," he
says abruptly.  "You were very stand-offish when she
called on you the other day.  She's the most popular
woman in London, and the prettiest.  You two ought
to be friends."
</p>

<p>
"I don't like her," answers Lauraine coldly.
</p>

<p>
"Don't like her!" he sneers.  "No, of course not.
That's just like a woman.  The moment a man praises
one of your own sex to you, it's quite sufficient reason
for you to dislike her.  Pray, what's your objection?"
</p>

<p>
Lauraine colours faintly.
</p>

<p>
"She is loud and fast.  She ridicules every good
and honest feeling, and I think she is very malicious."
</p>

<p>
"The secret of her success perhaps," laughs her
husband.  "People are afraid of her sharp tongue.
<i>Tant mieux</i>.  But she is at all events a woman one would
not get tired of.  Few know how to make themselves
more agreeable."
</p>

<p>
"To men, perhaps."
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's paying us a great compliment.  A
woman making herself agreeable to women is taking a
great deal of trouble for no purpose unless, of course, they
have the <i>entrée</i> where she has not.  But Lady Jean
goes everywhere."
</p>

<p>
"And Lady Jean's husband?" asks Lauraine.
</p>

<p>
Sir Francis laughs.  "Well, one doesn't see much
of him certainly.  But he's worth nearly a million,
for all that.  The earl wouldn't have let his daughter
marry him if he hadn't been."
</p>

<p>
"Was Lady Jean poor?"
</p>

<p>
"Very poor.  The Earl of Killery had six daughters.
She was the youngest, and the only one who has married.
She's been married six years now."
</p>

<p>
"You knew her before&mdash;before&mdash;&mdash;" hesitates Lauraine.
</p>

<p>
"Before I married you?  Oh, yes.  We were very
good friends always.  That's why I hope you and she
will hit it off.  She'll be of great use to you."
</p>

<p>
Lauraine is silent.  In her own mind she thinks she
shall never be able to "hit it off," as Sir Francis expresses
it.  She and Lady Jean are totally opposite in many
respects, and she has that instinctive antipathy to her
which a pure and high-principled woman often
conceives for one whose morals are lax, whose nature is
coarse, whose views, tastes and opinions are utterly
antagonistic to her own.
</p>

<p>
The carriage stops at last.  They get out and are
marshalled up a crowded staircase and into yet more crowded
rooms.  Lady Jean Saloman receives them cordially.
She looks radiant.  If not a positively beautiful woman
she at least is a woman who always contrives to make
herself immediately noticed even amidst beauty.
She is very tall; dresses superbly: wears jewels fit
for an empress, and is too much a woman of the world
not to know the worth of popularity.
</p>

<p>
Her own birth and breeding were irreproachable,
and she could be <i>grande dame</i> to the tips of her toes
when she pleased.  But when the part did not suit,
she varied it according to her own fancy.  She was
not a young woman now&mdash;that is to say, she was on
the wrong side of thirty; but she was handsome and
dashing-looking, and had a host of admirers, and did
pretty much as she liked with her husband, who was a
dark Jewish-looking man, rarely seen in her
drawing-rooms, but known to have carried many wonderful
speculations to a successful issue, and to have so much
money that even her wildest extravagances could be
indulged without fear of consequences.
</p>

<p>
Lady Jean was on the very highest pinnacle of
social success at present, and the novelty amused her,
though the fact of being constantly <i>en grande tenue</i> was
rather a bore, and there was a dash of Bohemianism in
her character, due to her Irish blood, which would
have vent occasionally.  The said element, however,
was kept carefully out of sight of the very great and
exclusive personages who received her as one of themselves.
She slipped into her two characters as occasion
demanded, and played them so skilfully that her
respective audiences applauded each with rapture, and
took each as the real thing.
</p>

<p>
Those outside that magic pale of "exclusiveness"
sighed enviously as they saw her leave their ranks from
time to time, and soar upwards to that purer and rarer
stratum of the social atmosphere which their lungs
were deemed unfit to breathe.  "We are quite as good
as she," they would murmur discontentedly.
</p>

<p>
And so they doubtless were, only they had not learnt
her secret&mdash;the secret of keeping on good terms with
Society, and yet indulging in a hundred little frolicsome
escapades by way of variety, without offending the
strait-laced prejudices and high-toned morality of the
one set, or debarring herself from the questionable
amusements of the other.
</p>

<p>
To-night Lady Jean is very gracious, very affable,
very dignified; her rooms are thronged with great
personages.  A list of nothing but titles will fill the pages
of the <i>Court Journal</i> that describes her "reception"
to-morrow, and she feels that she is a person of much
consequence.  Lady Vavasour looks at her with more
curiosity than she has yet evinced.  Her husband's
words have aroused her interest.
</p>

<p>
Lady Jean is attired in some wonderful combination
of deep ruby and old gold that suits her dark beauty to
perfection.  Lauraine gazes at her with a sort of wonder.
It has never struck her before that the woman is so
marvellously handsome.
</p>

<p>
They pass on with the rest of the crowd after a few words.
In one of the rooms a great singer is singing.  Lauraine
stands and listens.  Some one comes up to her and offers
his hand.  She just glances up and smiles as she takes
it.  Neither of them speaks.  Only two eager blue eyes
take in every detail of her dress and appearance, and
give so glad a welcome in their glance that perhaps it is
as well she does not see it.
</p>

<p>
The song is over.  The crowd move about.  Keith
Athelstone bends close to Lauraine.  "Let me find you a
seat," he says.  "These rooms are stifling."
</p>

<p>
Lauraine nods and takes his arm.  Her husband has
gone back to the staircase and&mdash;Lady Jean.
</p>

<p>
"I hardly know any one here," she says at last.
"It is the first time I have come to the house."
</p>

<p>
"Is it?" answers Keith, rather indifferently.
"There are heaps of big swells here, I believe.  Pity
Mrs. Bradshaw Woollffe can't be among them.  How
delighted she would be!"
</p>

<p>
"How long do you stay with her?" asked Lauraine.
</p>

<p>
"I scarcely know.  I am looking out for a set of
rooms; but I haven't found anything I like yet."
</p>

<p>
"Are you so hard to please?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't think so.  But I must have lots of room
and something green to look at.  I wonder if I dare ask
your assistance in the furnishing line.  I'm afraid I
shall make an awful muddle of it."
</p>

<p>
Lauraine laughs.  "Are you going in for the
æsthetic style&mdash;peacock-blue, and sage-green and
yellow?  Oh, yes&mdash;I shall be delighted to help you.
We'll drive to Morris's and select things together."
</p>

<p>
<i>Together</i>!  His heart gives a quick throb as he hears
that word.  He wonders whether she has forgotten.  He
feels a little impatient of this calm friendliness with which
she always treats him.  She ignores the past so utterly
that at times he feels impelled to say or do something
desperate, if only to awaken her from that calm, and
know that she can feel still.
</p>

<p>
The attraction she had had for him is potent as ever.
All his rage and indignation had not killed it&mdash;the
barrier in his path seemed but to rouse it to fresh life
when they met again.
</p>

<p>
No woman in the world was to him what Lauraine
was.  No woman ever would be, he felt assured.  Had
he been wise he would have shunned her presence so
long as he knew it could exercise its old potent witchery.
</p>

<p>
But who is wise that loves?
</p>

<p>
"She is quite safe," he would tell himself restlessly.
"And for myself&mdash;if it hurts, it is my own fault.  I
must see her sometimes."
</p>

<p>
He had grown to look upon Lauraine as martyred
to her mother's selfishness.  He knew she had never
cared for her husband.  He saw that even in this short
space of time they were drifting slowly&mdash;surely apart.
</p>

<p>
"And I would have made her so happy!" he thought
to himself in those hours of solitude when the
maddening recollection of her face was always before him.
</p>

<p>
He almost hated her at such times; hated her because
he could not forget her, and all his riches seemed nothing
in comparison with just&mdash;her love.
</p>

<p>
She was quite unsuspicious as yet.  She thought he
must have got over his boyish infatuation long since,
and that their friendship was as real to him as to her.
He was careful enough not to undeceive her, for he
dreaded above all the sentence of banishment she would
inevitably pronounce.  She had grown so much colder
and prouder since her marriage, he thought.
</p>

<p>
The seat is found, and side by side they sit, talking of
a hundred different things that for them have a common
interest.  To Lauraine it is the most natural thing
in the world that Keith should be beside her, and she can
always talk to him as she can to no one else.  Yet
there is that about her which keeps all dangerous allusions
in check, which sometimes chills and sometimes awes
the wild, hot, young heart beating so restlessly by her
side.  He tries a hundred times to speak, and yet&mdash;he
dares not.  "She would never forgive," he thinks to
himself.  "It would seem almost an insult now."
</p>

<p>
For he knows that there is one tie which sanctifies her
heart, and sets her far above the touch and fear of a
selfish passion.  It is her love for her child.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Your wife and her old playfellow seem devoted to
each other," remarks Lady Jean, as she leans on Sir
Francis Vavasour's arm, and makes the tour of her
splendid rooms.
</p>

<p>
He looks carelessly at the couple in question.  They
are sitting in an alcove, the soft hues of the hangings
and the rich tints of flowers framing them in with a
glow of colour.  Keith is bending over Lauraine; he
holds her bouquet in his hand, and toys restlessly
with the fragrant blossoms.  Her face is softly flushed,
the long dark lashes sweep her cheek, a little smile, half
tender, half sad, plays about her lips.
</p>

<p>
"What a handsome couple they would have made,"
continues Lady Jean blandly.  "Just seem suited
for each other.  You ought to feel flattered, <i>mon ami</i>,
that you carried the day."
</p>

<p>
"Pshaw! they are like brother and sister," mutters
Sir Francis impatiently.
</p>

<p>
"Are they?  How very charming!  Only brothers
and sisters as a rule don't seem quite so devoted to each
other.  But, of course, the relationship and the 'seeming'
it are two very different things.  Do you know, I think
your wife is very beautiful."
</p>

<p>
"You are very good to say so."
</p>

<p>
Lady Jean laughs.  "My flattery is quite sincere.  I
really admire her very much.  She is a little too grave
and serious, perhaps, but that is a fault on the right side.
There is too much fastness and vulgarity in society
nowadays.  A quiet woman is quite refreshing."
</p>

<p>
"Lauraine never used to be grave and serious,"
Sir Francis remarks somewhat moodily.  "She was one
of the merriest and most amusing girls I ever met."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" observes his companion sententiously.  "<i>That</i>
was before she married you.  Somehow marriage does
alter some women amazingly."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
</h3>

<p>
"Lauraine is very much changed," laments Mrs. Douglas
to a select coterie of friends, on one of those
chilly spring afternoons when they have dropped in to
sip souchong and talk scandal in her pretty drawing-room.
It is her "day."  There are heaps of women scattered
about&mdash;there are a few men.  The lights are subdued.
There is a pleasant fragrance of tea, and the scents of
flowers fill the air, and the babble of many voices sounds
cheerfully amidst it all.
</p>

<p>
"Changed!" says one of the friends to whom she has
addressed that remark; "in what way?"
</p>

<p>
"So quiet and cold and&mdash;odd," Mrs. Douglas answers;
"says she hates society, detests going out, takes up
artists and singers, and all sorts of queer people.  I really
expect to see her going about soon in a terra-cotta gown,
and wearing no corsets, and looking as great a fool as
Lady Etwynde.  So absurd, you know, for a young
woman, and a pretty woman.  Of course, Lady
Etwynde is a duke's daughter, and can do what she likes;
besides, she's so lovely nothing could make her a
fright, though she only turns it to account by being the
most eccentric woman in London.  I don't blame her.
If you can't be remarkable in one way, it's just as well
to be it in another.  But the people one meets there&mdash;it
really is <i>too</i> awful.  Just the sort of creatures that
<i>Punch</i> takes off.  And Lauraine is always there; so
tiresome, because Lady Etwynde's day is the same as
mine, and so she can never come here."
</p>

<p>
"I thought it was odd never meeting her at your
house," remarks one of the coterie.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, that's how it is you never see her," resumes
Mrs. Douglas, somewhat hurriedly.  "She and Lady
Etwynde are inseparable, though I'm sure I can't
imagine why."
</p>

<p>
"I met her&mdash;your daughter, I mean&mdash;at the Salomans'
the other night," remarks a tall, fair woman, leaning
languidly back in her chair.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know she was there," says Mrs. Douglas,
colouring slightly.  "Charming woman, Lady Jean!"
</p>

<p>
"Very," answers her friend dryly.  "I&mdash;I suppose
Lady Vavasour never heard anything about&mdash;<i>that</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, there was nothing&mdash;nothing; he assured me so
himself.  I would not have trusted my child's happiness
to his care had he not done so.  The world is <i>so</i>
censorious, dear Mrs. Chetwynde."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Chetwynde laughs.  "True; but all the same
there is no smoke without fire, you know&mdash;and Lady
Jean was awfully wild about his marriage."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Douglas looked uncomfortable.  "I don't know
anything about her.  But I am quite sure she is all right.
She is received everywhere."
</p>

<p>
"Of course," smiles her friend.  "And the very
openness of their friendship is guarantee sufficient for
its perfect harmlessness; just like Lauraine's with
Keith Athelstone."
</p>

<p>
"Keith Athelstone!" exclaims Mrs. Douglas, turning
very white.  "What do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"They are always together," says Mrs. Chetwynde
maliciously.  "So they were in Rome, for the matter of
that.  But, of course, they are very old friends&mdash;brought
up as children, and all that?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course," says Mrs. Douglas loftily.  "Why,
they were like brother and sister.  Surely no one is so
uncharitable as&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"My dear, we are all uncharitable, more or less.  And
Lauraine is very pretty, and Sir Francis not <i>quite</i> so
devoted as he might be, considering it was a love-match&mdash;so
you said.  I think I should give Lauraine a hint,
if I were you."
</p>

<p>
"Lauraine is quite capable of managing her own
affairs," said Mrs. Douglas pettishly.  In her own mind
she thinks she knows how such a hint would be received.
"Keith is only a boy.  Lauraine looks upon him just as
a brother&mdash;always did.  She is accustomed to order him
about, and have him beside her.  Pray don't listen to
such ill-natured gossip."
</p>

<p>
But all the time an uncomfortable memory is rising
up before her.  She sees a pale young face and the fiery
wrath of two blue eyes, and hears the passionate
reproaches of Keith Athelstone's lips as he tells her of
his ruined life.  Good heavens! what does he mean?
Why does he stay by Lauraine's side now?  She feels
nervous and unsettled, and almost resolves she will
speak to Lauraine, and give her that word of caution
which her friend has suggested.  The world is so
wicked, and after all&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Her thoughts are interrupted by fresh arrivals.
Into the exclusive circle in which Mrs. Douglas' soul
delights, stride the massive proportions and gorgeous
sweeping draperies of Mrs. Bradshaw B. Wooliffe.
Following her is a little dainty figure&mdash;a sort of modern
Dresden shepherdess in point of colouring and attire.
She is introduced by Mrs. Wooliffe as "My niece from
New York, Miss Anastasia Jane Jefferson."
</p>

<p>
Every one looks at her.  Every one wonders whether
it is prettiness, or piquancy, or <i>chic</i>, that makes the
radiant face so bewitching&mdash;the tiny figure so
attractive, and one among the coterie, the Belgravian
matron, with <i>demoiselles à marier</i>, looks virtuously
indignant and annoyed at the intrusion.
</p>

<p>
"She is sure to be fast and talk with that awful twang,
that's one comfort," she thinks, as with the coldest
and stiffest of bows she greets the new-comer.
</p>

<p>
But Miss Jefferson is not fast or vulgar, and though
her accent and expression are decidedly American, they
have a piquant charm of their own that the younger
members of the conclave listen to enviously, and the
men seem to find irresistibly attractive.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Bradshaw B. Wooliffe and her niece fairly break
up the select groups and <i>tête à têtes</i>, and make themselves
the centre of attraction and attention.  The loud voice
and hearty laughter of the elder lady peal through the
room, to the utter annihilation of softer voices and
confidential whispers.
</p>

<p>
"We have just come from Lady Etwynde's
reception," she says, laughing immoderately.  "I
reckon you people are having some fun out of your
new craze.  Guess <i>she's</i> gone pretty nigh out of her
mind, at all events."
</p>

<p>
"What was it like?  Do tell us," chime in one or
two voices&mdash;voices of outsiders to whom the Lady&mdash;or,
as she loved to call herself, the "Ladye"&mdash;Etwynde
Fitz-Herbert is a sort of unknown wonder.  Her
sayings and doings are chronicled by society journals;
but her circle of intimates and associates is very limited.
They begin to wonder how Mrs. Bradshaw B. Woollffe
gained admittance.  That lady now informs them.
</p>

<p>
"Well," she commences, looking round at the
attentive faces, "I was calling at Lauraine's&mdash;beg
pardon, I suppose I should say Lady Vavasour's&mdash;and
she took me with her and Keith.  Keith is a great chum
of the 'Ladye' Etwynde's.  We got to her house&mdash;a
real lovely place with a big garden, out Kensington
way; all red brick, no windows to speak of, but lots
of <i>frames</i>, and a hall&mdash;my! the queerest place&mdash;all done
with matting, and so dark, and everywhere double doors
and plush curtains, 'of a sad sage-green,' to use Keith's
expression.  Such a silent place, not a sound anywhere.
Well, we went into a room, also very dim and a great
deal of green and yellow about it, and huge pots of
sunflowers in the windows, and the very queerest chairs,
and on every chair sat a woman, and behind every
chair stood a man.  They were all quite still, and had
their eyes fixed on the sunflowers and their bodies
twisted into the queerest attitudes.  I stared some, I
can tell you.  Lauraine went up to a tall, beautiful
woman dressed in a clinging gown of terra-cotta
stuff&mdash;such a gown!  My!  Worth never had anything to
do with <i>that</i> frock, I guess.  She came forward and spoke
to me.  'You are not one of us, but you are welcome,'
she said.  Her voice was very sad and very sweet.
</p>

<p>
"'This is one of our contemplative afternoons,' she
said, when I had bowed&mdash;speak, I really couldn't.
'We do but sit still, and <i>yearn</i>.'"
</p>

<p>
"What?" ejaculated the listeners.
</p>

<p>
"Guess you're through," laughs Mrs. Woollffe.
"Well, so was I."
</p>

<p>
"'Yes,' she went on.  'We yearn for all that is
most soul-uplifting.  We each set a distinct object
before our mind's eye, and absorb ourselves in its
contemplation.  These moments are truly precious
for those who can be brought to appreciate their intensity.
We are most of us earnest students of our faith&mdash;disciples
of culture&mdash;worshippers of the beautiful&mdash;the
far-reaching&mdash;the subtle&mdash;the sublime!'
</p>

<p>
"'And don't you ever speak?' I asked her; for
of all the vacant-eyed, sleepy idiots in creation I never
came across such a set as were 'yearning' there.
</p>

<p>
"'Speak&mdash;oh yes&mdash;in season and at proper times,'
she says.  'But thought is often more beautiful than
words, and language is deficient in much that might
clothe and dignify our ideas.'
</p>

<p>
"Keith chimed in here.  'Yes,' he said; 'they <i>are</i> apt
to sound ridiculous when it comes to clothing them in
common-place speech.'"  The listeners exchange glances.
</p>

<p>
"And this was really how they went on&mdash;how
idiotic!" murmurs Mrs. Douglas.  "I knew Lady
Etwynde was always very eccentric, but I think she is
quite going out of her mind now.  I hope she won't
imbue Lauraine with any of her absurd ideas.  How
was she dressed&mdash;Lauraine, I mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh! quite æsthetic!" exclaims Mrs. Woollffe.
"Indian silk, creamy coloured, big puffs, and very
clinging about the skirt, and an 'intense' hat.  I know
it was intense, because Keith said so."
</p>

<p>
"What made Mr. Athelstone go to such a nonsensical
affair?" demands Mrs. Douglas, frowning.
</p>

<p>
"Didn't ask him.  S'pose he likes to 'yearn' a bit
also.  Perhaps it's refreshing to fix one's mind on an
object and meditate upon it.  Can't say myself.  Don't
think I ever tried it."
</p>

<p>
"And didn't they <i>do</i> anything?" inquires Mrs. Chetwynde.
</p>

<p>
"They talked an almighty queer jargon, if that was
doing anything.  A lot about 'disciples' and 'searching
after the unknown,' and the 'abstruseness of the
beautiful,' which was the religion of culture.  Lauraine
saw some snowdrops and violets and admired them,
and then some one burst out about the fierce beauty
of the sunflower and the grand teachings of the tiger-lily.
I confess I felt beat then, and said so, but Lady Etwynde
only smiled that sad, pale smile of hers, and murmured:
'Ah, Nature has much to teach you.  Her great marvels
are yet a blank.  To comprehend her is a power given
only to the chosen few.'  I felt uncommon near saying
that <i>she</i> resembled Nature there, for I am blessed if I
comprehended her."
</p>

<p>
"And one hears such wonderful stories about this
Lady Etwynde," murmurs a voice in the background.
"Really, it seems quite disappointing."
</p>

<p>
"She is real pretty," remarks Miss Anastasia Jefferson.
</p>

<p>
"Pretty?  But then she dresses so oddly, and her
hair&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"A club behind and a nimbus in front," laughs the
pretty American.  "Trying, but still seems to suit
her.  Real cunning she looked when she lay back in
her chair with her eyes turned up&mdash;so."
</p>

<p>
She imitates her so exactly that there is a well-bred
ripple of laughter among the circle, but behind Miss
Jefferson's back they will all denounce the vulgarity and
bad taste of ridiculing any one to whose house she had
just been.  Of course, they themselves never do such
things!  Mrs. Douglas draws a little nearer to
Mrs. Bradshaw B. Woollffe.  She wants to question her
concerning Keith Athelstone.
</p>

<p>
"You might have brought your young friend here,"
she says affably.
</p>

<p>
"Guess he didn't want to come," answers Mrs. Woollffe
bluntly.  "At least he said so."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Douglas colours faintly.  "He has so many
engagements; money of course makes a young man
immensely popular," she says, with a cold smile.
</p>

<p>
"'Tain't money that's got anything to do with Keith
Athelstone's popularity," answers Mrs. Woollffe sharply.
"He's just one of the nicest young fellows I've ever
known, and people don't take long to find that out.  His
manners are perfect.  He can dress like a gentleman
without looking a fop.  He's plenty to say and says it
well, and he's most uncommonly good-looking.  Ain't
that enough to make a young man run after?"
</p>

<p>
"Still," says Mrs. Douglas sweetly, "if he had no
money, Society would turn its back on him to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"Society?" echoes Mrs. Bradshaw B. Woollffe.  "I
guess you mean the mothers in society.  I've my own
opinion about the gals."
</p>

<p>
"Does he&mdash;does he seem to care about any woman
in particular?" asks Mrs. Douglas.  "I suppose
he means to marry and settle down now."
</p>

<p>
"Guess he don't," says Mrs. Woollffe.  "Likes to be
free, so he says, and quite right too."
</p>

<p>
"Then there is no one&mdash;no girl&mdash;he pays attention
to," persists Mrs. Douglas determinedly.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Bradshaw B. Woollffe looks at her with aroused
curiosity, and a faint smile comes to her lips.  "Oh,
yes, there is <i>some one</i> he pays great attention to," she
says, slowly and distinctly, "but no girl as you say&mdash;she
is a married woman."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
</h3>

<p>
The season rolls on with Fashion tied to its wheels.
Society is on its treadmill once more, hard at work and
calling it pleasure.  To young Lady Vavasour, courted
and admired as she is, the life seems to have grown
ineffably wearisome.  All around her now is gorgeous,
restless, insatiable.  She plays her own part amidst
it all, and finds an endless monotony about it.
The glare, the fever, the unrest, oppress her with a
vague wonder and an inward contempt, for those who
live in it and for it alone, and misname the craving
for false excitement&mdash;pleasure.
</p>

<p>
She has seen very little of her husband this
season.  He has his own engagements and occupations&mdash;she
hers.  Lauraine feels often very lonely and very
sad.  The total want of sympathy between Sir Francis
and herself becomes more and more apparent, and she
knows very well that among all her host of acquaintances
there is not one whom she can really count as a
friend&mdash;except, perhaps, Mrs. Bradshaw B. Woollffe.
</p>

<p>
Of late a strange fear has come to her&mdash;one she hardly
dares breathe to herself.  It is connected with Keith
Athelstone.  She has been trying to make herself believe
that that youthful episode is quite forgotten; that her
marriage has put it out of his head; that his plainly
shown preference for her society is only the outcome of
past association.  He has said no word to undeceive
her; but then perhaps words are the least dangerous of
the shafts of warfare in Love's armoury.  A look, a
sigh, a broken sentence&mdash;these often convey more than
any set form of speech, and between Keith and Lauraine
is a subtle comprehension that makes them utterly
independent of words.  A look across a crowded room,
a smile at some witticism caught by their ears when
in the midst of some brilliant circle, a glance as some
words of a song, or tender strain of music, touch some
memory in their hearts, or awake a thrill of pain or
pleasure&mdash;these are enough to draw them together by
the imperceptible links of a common sympathy.  But
in it all Lauraine suspects no danger.  It seems to her
that they are so utterly divided, it is impossible Keith
can forget that fact.  Perhaps he does forget it, but
not in the way she imagines.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The Lady Etwynde is holding a reception.  It is
not purely æsthetic this time, and "yearning" is
not an item of the programme.  Literary people,
dramatic people, artistic people, musical people&mdash;a
strange and somewhat odd-looking throng&mdash;crowd the
"sad green" rooms, which are all thrown open <i>en suite</i>,
and where the "fierce beauty" of the sunflower may
be seen in all its glory this warm summer night.
</p>

<p>
Dissimilar as they seem, yet Lauraine and Lady
Etwynde are very good friends.  Lauraine has
discovered how much good sense, cleverness and
cordial feeling live beneath that mask of eccentricity
which the fair æsthete shows to the outer world, and she
finds her entertainments far more amusing than many
of the others she attends.
</p>

<p>
To-night Lauraine comes alone, Sir Francis having
declined to be present at what he terms "such d&mdash;&mdash;d
humbug."  It is nearly midnight when she arrives,
and the rooms are crowded.  She sees the Lady Etwynde
attired in a fearful and wonderful gown, with skirts
more clinging, and puffs more voluminous, and hair
more "tousled" than ever, and in her hand is a fan of
peacock's feathers, which she from time to time waves
slowly and gracefully to and fro.
</p>

<p>
Even all her enemies and detractors cannot deny that
the Lady Etwynde is essentially beautiful and graceful.
Her every movement and attitude are a study; her soft,
clinging draperies float and sway to her rhythmic
motions in a way that is at once the envy and despair
of her imitators and admirers.  To see her walk across
a room is a treat&mdash;a poem, as her disciples say, and
countless have been the effusions inspired by her doing so.
</p>

<p>
As Lauraine greets her, Keith Athelstone approaches.
She had not expected to find him there, and a little
flush of pleasure rises to her face.
</p>

<p>
The Lady Etwynde looks at them with grave, soft
eyes, and a little puzzled wonder on her face.  She
has heard some of the buzzing from Society's wings,
and she is beginning also to notice that Keith is the
very shadow of the beautiful "Lady Lauraine."
</p>

<p>
"I have a great treat in store for you," she says, in
her slow, soft voice; "Signor Alfieri has promised to
sing for me to-night.  You know him, do you not?"
</p>

<p>
"I have heard him at the opera, of course," says
Lauraine.  "But never in a room.  How charming."
</p>

<p>
"He is the most perfect Faust I have ever seen on
the stage," continues the Lady Etwynde.  "To hear
him sing the 'Salve Dinora' is quite too exquisitely
divine.  Yes; he is going to honour my poor little
entertainment."
</p>

<p>
"You are very fortunate," remarks Keith Athelstone.
"I know he refused to sing at the Duchess of
St. Alban's 'At Home' the other night, despite all
entreaties."
</p>

<p>
"We must not miss a note," says the hostess tranquilly.
"I think I will ask him to sing now.  I have
been waiting for Lauraine."
</p>

<p>
Keith offers his arm, but the "Ladye" declines it,
and makes a sign to an æsthetic poet, who looks starved
enough to be "yearning" after the substantial goods
of life.  Then she floats off in her swaying, sensuous
fashion, and Keith and Lauraine follow in silence.
Seldom has Lauraine looked so lovely as she does
tonight.  Her dress is of the palest primrose shade, and
of that exquisitely soft texture of silk called <i>satin
merveilleux</i>, which drapes itself in graceful, clinging folds.
A bodice and train of this shows a mass of creamy lace
beneath.  Some Gloire de Dijon roses nestle at her
bosom, and a few more carelessly intermingled with
maidenhair fern, and knotted together by long trails
of primrose-coloured ribbon, are held in her hand.  Her
hair is without ornament, and the beautiful throat and
neck are unmarred by any jewels, and gleam white as
marble.
</p>

<p>
Keith Athelstone's heart gives one great painful throb
as he moves on by her side.  He thinks he has never
seen her look so exquisite, so dangerously attractive,
as to-night.  "Sir Francis not coming?" he says
carelessly, and from his voice no one would suspect
the feelings at work within his breast.
</p>

<p>
"No," says Lauraine.  "He doesn't like æstheticism,
you know."
</p>

<p>
"They are not in such strong force to-night," says
Keith, glancing round to see to whom Lauraine has
just bowed.  "Still, a good many planted about, I think.
It's the men get over me.  Did you ever see such guys?"
</p>

<p>
"Can't Lady Etwynde convert you?" asks Lauraine,
smiling a little.
</p>

<p>
"To make myself up in that fashion&mdash;no, thank you.
Besides, Nature hasn't given me the class of features
necessary, and I don't suppose even a prolonged course of
starvation would reduce me to such skinniness in the
matter of legs and arms as those 'yearners' can boast of."
</p>

<p>
"No; it would take a good time to make you thin,
I imagine," Lauraine answers, with an involuntary
glance at the splendid proportions of her old playmate.
"So much the better.  All men should be tall and
well-made.  Nature should establish it as a rule."
</p>

<p>
"And all women beautiful, of course?"
</p>

<p>
"Beauty is not the only attraction a woman need
possess," Lauraine says thoughtfully.  "I remember
hearing some one remark once that the most beautiful
women might win the greatest amount of admiration,
but not the greatest love."
</p>

<p>
"There is a class of beauty that can command both.
Of course, there are women who are eaten up with the
vanity and satisfaction of their own charms.  To my
thinking, no amount of personal loveliness could
compensate for bad temper, ignorance, or self-conceit."
</p>

<p>
"I think so too," Lauraine answers, meeting a
sudden glance of the blue eyes, and colouring faintly
beneath the warm admiration they speak.  "But, as
a rule, men go mad after a beautiful face, and don't
trouble themselves about anything else beneath it."
</p>

<p>
"I should never do that," Keith remarks quietly.
"I like a woman for what is in her&mdash;not for the straight
features, and fair complexion, and good eyes."
</p>

<p>
"You are hard to please," Lauraine remarks,
glancing down at her flowers.
</p>

<p>
He makes her no answer whatever.
</p>

<p>
There is a sudden hush now in the crowded rooms&mdash;a
silence of expectation.  Keith finds a seat for
Lauraine on a low ottoman near one of the windows, and
stands there beside her.  The moon is shining clear and
brilliant in the sky above, and streams over the quaint
flower-beds and trees in the garden.  The sweet sultry
summer night is full of beauty and fragrance&mdash;it acts
like a spell on the warm, imaginative temperament
and ardent fancy of the young man.
</p>

<p>
Across the silence a chord of music breaks.  With
his eyes still fixed on the garden and the sky, Keith
Athelstone waits and listens.
</p>

<p>
The voice of the great singer thrills across the rooms
in that most exquisite of strains which Faust utters
to his love.  Lauraine's heart grows chill for a moment,
then leaps up and beats with a sudden vivid emotion
that fills her veins like fire, and holds her spell-bound
to the end.  In that moment it seems to her as if some
revelation had come of all she has missed in life.  The
passionate music finds its way to her very soul, and
holds in suspense life, thought, memory.
</p>

<p>
There is a lull&mdash;a pause, and then a torrent of acclamation
fills the air.  The charm is snapped.
</p>

<p>
The hands that hold the roses tremble visibly.  She
sits there and is silent, and does not look up at the face
above her for answering sympathy, because of this
strange dread and ecstasy he may read upon her own.
</p>

<p>
He <i>has</i> read it, despite the downcast eyes.  He has
read it, and his own heart grows rapturous with a
sudden delight, and cold with as sudden a dread.
</p>

<p>
Fresh applause&mdash;fresh entreaties.  A moment's
silence, and then the great singer seats himself at the
piano, and pours out again in the matchless melody of
his voice these words:
</p>

<p class="poem">

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On land or sea,<br>

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
He has set the words to music of his own.  Music
sad and gay and triumphant all in one.  Music that
finds its way from ear to heart, and fairly carries away
the listeners.  As he ceases&mdash;as the rapturous
exclamations of the crowd sound stormily after the
long silence&mdash;Lauraine looks up and meets Keith
Athelstone's eyes.
</p>

<p>
Only a look!
</p>

<p>
But looks have broken the fetters of a lifetime's
silence before now, and in that moment the secret of
two hearts is revealed as clearly and distinctly as if
a trumpet-blast had shouted it to their ears.
</p>

<p>
Their eyes droop.  Neither speaks.  A moment
or two pass on.  Then comes a hoarse whisper to
Lauraine's ear.
</p>

<p>
"Come away from this crowd; it is stifling, and
that man has spoilt all other singing for to-night."
</p>

<p>
Without a word she rises and takes his arm.  She
feels like one in a dream.  Senses, feelings&mdash;all are
lulled to a strange mysterious repose, and now and
then her heart thrills with a dreamy rapturous ecstasy.
</p>

<p>
The memory of that perfect melody is about her
still, and follows her out into the shadows of the night,
and the dim walks of the quaint old garden.  She
feels disturbed, perplexed, but almost happy.  She has
not noticed where he is taking her; only the breath
of the cool night air is on her brow, and her eyes, dark
and passionate as his own, gaze up at the tranquil
lustre of the stars.  Under the trees they stand, and
face one another at last.  He sees only a slender white
figure, with the moon shedding its silver rays around
it, and two quivering lips that part as if to speak.
With a sudden ungovernable impulse he draws her to
his breast, and on the trembling mouth spends the
pent-up passion of his heart in one long kiss.

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
</h3>

<p>
For a moment&mdash;one mad moment&mdash;Lauraine forgets
all else save that she loves.  Then she snatches herself
away from those fierce-clasping arms and starts back,
covering her crimson cheeks with her hands, while at
her feet the cluster of roses falls, and lies unheeded.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Keith!" she sobs, terrified and dismayed.
</p>

<p>
He recoils as if a blow had struck him.  His eyes&mdash;<i>bad</i>
blue eyes, indeed, now&mdash;burn with eager light.  A
thousand mad, wild words rush to his lips, but he does
not speak them.  He is striving for an instant's
self-command.  "Forgive me," he says.  "I&mdash;I forgot.
You used to let me kiss you in the old days, you know."
</p>

<p>
"The old days," she says, and her hands drop, and
white and sad she stands before him, looking back at
his face with agonized eyes.  "I thought you had
forgotten them long ago!"
</p>

<p>
"Since your wedding-day, you mean?" he says
bitterly.  "No, Lauraine&mdash;I do not forget easily, and
you are not the sort of woman a man can forget.
Heaven knows, I tried hard enough.  I did everything
in my power to drive you out of my head those twelve
months after your marriage.  A black year that is to
look back upon, Lauraine; and you gave it to me."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, hush!" she says entreatingly; "you have no
right to speak like this now, and I have no right to
listen."
</p>

<p>
"No right," he says, and all the rich, full music of
his voice has grown hoarse and harsh with strong
emotion.  "I <i>have</i> a right&mdash;every right.  The right
of loving you with the truest, fondest love man ever
gave to woman.  I never meant to meet you again&mdash;I
never sought you; but Fate threw you in my way
in Rome, and after all those weary months I&mdash;I could
not help being glad of it.  You&mdash;of course it was
nothing to you: it never will be&mdash;you are so cold;
you never cared for me as I for you, and now&mdash;oh,
God&mdash;if you only knew <i>how</i> I love you!"
</p>

<p>
Lauraine shivers from head to foot.  It is not his
words, his reproaches, that fill her with so strange a
dread&mdash;it is herself.  She knows that she loves him as
intensely and as uselessly as he loves her, and that
before their two lives now stretches a broad black
gulf they cannot cross or evade.
</p>

<p>
She is quite speechless.  The awful ordeal of that
wedding-day comes back before her eyes, fresh and
vivid as if it had been but yesterday.  She knows she
has committed a fatal error, but it is too late now to
rectify it.  Presently Keith speaks again.
</p>

<p>
"I think you have spoilt my whole life," he says.
"Thought drives me mad, or to distractions that are
ruinous to body and soul.  I feel as if I cannot bear
to live as I do.  Why," he continues passionately,
"do you know, I never stand alone on a moonlight
night, or look at any beauty in nature or in art, or
see the stars shining in the sky, but I long and long till
longing drives me desperate for just your presence
beside me, your voice on my ear.  I never hear a
strain of music that touches my soul but I long to turn
to you for answering sympathy.  I am young and rich,
and have life and the world before me, and yet there
is no single thing I can enjoy with any real heart-whole
enjoyment now.  There is always the one want that
drives me desperate&mdash;the one craving for <i>you</i>!"
</p>

<p>
Lauraine listens to the torrent of his words, and all
her soul seems rent and shaken.  In the old days, the
old boy and girl days together, she had never loved
Keith Athelstone as she loves him now, and that thought
terrifies her with a sense of her own wickedness and an
awful dread of the ordeal before her.
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry&mdash;so sorry," she says tremulously.  "I did
hope you had got over it&mdash;had forgotten&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Forgotten!" interrupts Keith bitterly.  "No;
I leave that for women."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think I forgot?" she cries, flashing round
upon him with sudden, tempestuous anger.  "I did
not.  My marriage was in a way forced upon me by
my mother.  You knew it, then.  Why do you say
such things to me now?  Am I not wretched enough?"
</p>

<p>
Her voice breaks into a faint sob, and all his heart
melts at a sign of grief from her.
</p>

<p>
"Are you wretched?" he says softly.  "Oh, my
poor darling, not half so wretched as I.  When you
gave yourself away from me you little knew what you
did.  I think I have never known one happy moment
since&mdash;nor ever shall again."
</p>

<p>
"Why do you tell me this?  Is it any use?" falters
Lauraine.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," he says wearily.  "I thought, perhaps,
you might pity me&mdash;be a little sorry for your work."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't talk like that," she entreats, lifting two
soft tear-wet eyes to the young, haggard, reproachful
face before her.  "Pity you&mdash;do you think I am a
stone; that I have no feeling?"
</p>

<p>
"Then you <i>are</i> sorry&mdash;a little sorry," he says, coming
nearer.  "Well, that is some consolation.  But I
can't live on that.  I want something more.  I don't
care how badly you think of me, Lauraine.  After
to-night I suppose I have just done for myself, but I
<i>will</i> hear you say what your eyes told me a little while
ago&mdash;say you love me."
</p>

<p>
His arms are wrapped around the slender, trembling
figure&mdash;he holds her closely to his breast and looks
down, down, into her eyes with all the fire and passion
of his impulsive nature burning in his own.  As she
meets that look the blood flies like flame through her
veins.  She feels escape is impossible.
</p>

<p>
"Don't ask me," she whispers faintly.
</p>

<p>
His look never changes.  "Answer me," he says.
</p>

<p>
Her eyes sink before that gaze, and all the lustre of
the summer night seems to sway and reel amidst the
leafy shadows.
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;I love you," she says, with sudden desperation.
"It is no new thing to tell you&mdash;Heaven forgive me
for saying it!  Is my shame complete&mdash;is there any
other confession you wish to force from me?"
</p>

<p>
His arms release her as suddenly as they had clasped
her.  "No," he says.  "Do not speak so bitterly.  I am
a brute, I know; but I was always a bad fellow, according
to your mother.  After all, it is a poor satisfaction to
know we are both in the same boat.  It makes my pain
no less to know you share it.  Well, I suppose I have
about done for myself now.  I may go galloping to the
downward road as fast as I like.  I have insulted you,
and I have made an utter fool of myself.  I'd give a
great deal not to have done it, but it's too late to say
that now.  Will you ever forgive me, Lorry?"
</p>

<p>
The old pet-name of their childish days slips out
unconsciously.  It moves Lauraine almost to tears.
How sad, how changed, how unutterably dreary is life
now!  "I have little to forgive," she says unsteadily.
"I share your fault.  Only&mdash;only&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hush!" he says, with sudden fierceness.  "I
know what you are going to say.  My folly has shut
me out from the only happiness I have.  How cruel
a <i>good</i> woman can be."
</p>

<p>
"It is not cruelty&mdash;it is safety," murmurs Lauraine,
with faltering voice.  "How can we meet and face
each other in the world knowing what we know?
Friendship between us is impossible&mdash;you have made
it so&mdash;and there can be&mdash;nothing more."
</p>

<p>
"I would rather <i>die</i> than lose you," says Keith
passionately.  "If you were happy it would be
different; but you are not, and your husband is a
blackguard, and half London knows it&mdash;even your
precious mother.  It was bad enough to stand aside
and see you sold to him, as you were; but it was
nothing to what it is now&mdash;now, when I know you are
not even happy.  Oh, Lauraine, God knows I would
have made you <i>that</i>, if it lay in any mortal's power!"
</p>

<p>
The hot colour comes into the beautiful, pale face on
which his eyes are fixed.  She holds out her hands
entreatingly.
</p>

<p>
"Say no more&mdash;it can do no good.  Whatever his
faults are, I am his wife.  Nothing can alter that!"
</p>

<p>
"Something can," is trembling on Keith's lips, but
he does not utter it.  Lauraine is not a woman to be
trifled with, and he dares not breathe a word that would
insult her dignity.  All that is boiling in his heart
he dares not even think.  He knows the purity of her
soul and life, and from that pedestal he cannot drag her
down to listen to the baser temptings that he might
have whispered to another woman.
</p>

<p>
For a moment they stand silently there.  At last
Keith speaks.  "I never meant to say such words to
you again.  I don't know what drove me mad to-night.
The music, and that song, and your look combined.
Oh! Lauraine, you can't love as I do, or you would
not scruple to take happiness while it lay in your power.
Life is so short, except for those who are miserable, and
in all our lives we shall only drag on a wretched
half-and-half existence.  I know you are the one woman
in the world for me, and I have lost you."
</p>

<p>
"You may forget&mdash;in&mdash;time," falters Lauraine, her
lips growing white at the pain of that thought, her whole
soul wrung with the unutterable anguish of this coming
parting.  "You are very young, Keith, and have the
world before you."
</p>

<p>
"The world is not you," he answers, looking down
from his tall height on the pale, sad face he loves so
madly.  "It is all nothingness and emptiness to me now.
But you won't be too cruel to me, Lorry&mdash;you won't
visit the sins of this evening too hardly on my head.
Don't tell me we are never to meet or see each other.
I can't live without a sight of you sometimes, and if
you will only say you forgive me I promise not to offend
in the same way again.  I have kept silence all these
months&mdash;I can do it again, and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Keith, don't tempt me like this," she entreats
sorrowfully.  "You know&mdash;you must know&mdash;that if
we love each other we cannot be 'only' friends.  It is
not safe for either of us."
</p>

<p>
"I shall not run away from you as if I were afraid,"
he says doggedly.  "I do not care to live a day if I
don't see you.  Can't you trust me? can't you believe
my word?  To-night shall be buried and forgotten,
unless&mdash;well, unless some happier fate awaits us in
the future.  We can be as we were, surely.  There is
no harm in that?"
</p>

<p>
<i>No harm in that?</i>
</p>

<p>
Lauraine echoes the words in her heart.  No harm&mdash;and
with the memory of this scene in both their hearts,
the thought of that passionate embrace, thrilling every
pulse, the rapture of one mad moment ever at hand to
repeat its tempting.  No harm in it!
</p>

<p>
A spasm of pain crosses her face.
</p>

<p>
"Your own sense, your own feelings, ought to tell
you that such a course is full of harm," she says faintly.
"But, of course, I have no power to banish you.  You
accuse me of blighting your life, and I deserve the
reproach.  I should have been firmer&mdash;truer; but I did
not think your love was so faithful, and in one weak
moment I yielded to my mother's persuasions.  The
harm is done past all undoing, and&mdash;and now you wish
to increase my unhappiness."
</p>

<p>
"I wish to be nearer to you&mdash;to see you sometimes;
that is all.  Is it a great deal to ask, considering what
I have suffered at your hands?"
</p>

<p>
Lauraine knows it is only paltering with temptation&mdash;only
leaping up fresh misery for herself and him in
time to come, but still she hesitates; she is only a
woman, and she loves.
</p>

<p>
Alas! that instant's hesitation undoes all the better
resolves she has been striving to make.  A window is
thrown open&mdash;voices sound&mdash;there comes an echo of
footsteps&mdash;they are alone no longer.
</p>

<p>
Keith bends over her impulsively.  "Say one word,
Lauraine&mdash;only one.  Say 'stay!'"
</p>

<p>
She draws her breath sharp and quick&mdash;his hand is
on her own&mdash;she feels its strong, warm pressure, and
all her good resolutions fly away.  Nothing seems in
her heart but one aching, passionate longing for his
presence&mdash;his voice.  Her face pales to the whiteness
of death, but to his ear steals the word he has asked
for&mdash;a whisper that seals their fate to-night&mdash;a whisper
for which the future holds its own Nemesis of dread
and of despair.
</p>

<p>
"Stay!" she says, and they pass out of the silver
radiance of the night as they entered it&mdash;together.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
</h3>

<p>
Keith Athelstone goes home that night to his rooms,
and feels in his heart that he has been a coward.
</p>

<p>
He knows he has had no right to wring from a woman's
weakness such a concession as that which he has won
from Lauraine.  She is not of the stuff that heroines
are made of, and truly there is no "heroic" element
about himself.  It is a great mistake to fancy people
are either very good or very bad in this world of ours.
Only too often there is simply a mixture of both in
their characters, and circumstances or strength of feeling
alternately throw their weight into the balance.
</p>

<p>
But alone to-night with his own thoughts, and with
the fever-pulse of passion dying slowly back into its
natural beat, Keith remembers what has passed, and
has the grace to feel a little ashamed of it, even though he
declares to himself over and over again that he would
act in just the same way under similar circumstances.
</p>

<p>
It is always hard for a second person to judge of our
actions.  No one can understand those secret springs&mdash;that
inner mechanism which moves us to do certain
things by certain impulses.  That one mad moment had
been to Keith Athelstone as the turning-point of his life.
A fiery temptation had to be withstood, or yielded to.
He had chosen to do the latter.
</p>

<p>
With his hot-blooded, impetuous temperament&mdash;with
the knowledge in his heart that he loved this woman
beyond and above all others in the world, beyond all
possibility of forgetfulness&mdash;he knew also that such a
thing as mere cold, prosaic friendship was an utter
impossibility.  At some moment like to-night, when
senses and heart thrilled with answering rapture, when
passion ran riot in his veins, when the aching and longing
of his life spoke one impetuous desire and hurled aside
all scruples, as the strength of Samson rent asunder
the withes that bound his mighty limbs&mdash;at some such
moment as this, forms and ceremonies, right and wrong,
all would be again forgotten, and those words of
Lauraine's would be verified when she said "there can be no
safety in such a compact."
</p>

<p>
He paces to and fro his rooms&mdash;the rooms Lauraine's
judgment and choice has selected and furnished&mdash;luxurious
apartments that look out on St. James's Park.
</p>

<p>
The radiance of the early summer dawn&mdash;beautiful
even in a great city&mdash;is over all the sky.  A faint breeze
rustles the trees&mdash;the birds sing and chirp among boughs
that are moist with the night's rain, just some tender
freshening shower that had fallen scarce an hour before.
</p>

<p>
Those young tired eyes of Keith Athelstone's look out
on it all, and a sigh parts his lips.
</p>

<p>
"There are so many women in the world," he mutters,
as he ceases his restless pacing, and leans against the
open window.  "So many that are beautiful and young,
and easy to win, and yet all my life is but a longing for
one who can be nothing to me.  How hard fate is!"
</p>

<p>
The cool, fresh air blows over his brow, but it does not
still its aching.  His whole soul is hardened, and bitterly
ashamed.  He has gained his will, he has forced Lauraine
to say "<i>Stay</i>," but all the same his triumph brings no
satisfaction.  That she loves him he knows, but she is
not a woman to lend herself to the base frailties of a lax
morality, to sink to the low level that pursues its joys
in secret, and smiles serenely on the face of society at
large.  There would be no playing at innocence with her,
and she was too proud as well as too passionate not to
suffer intensely in the struggle.  And then, after all,
how would it end&mdash;how do these poor pretences ever
end?  The barrier is so frail&mdash;a look, a word, a chance
meeting, and it is overthrown, and then&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
He springs impetuously to his feet here.  He dares
not pursue that train of thought any further.
</p>

<p>
"I won't think of the end," he mutters.  "I shall see her
still, and sufficient unto the day is the&mdash;evil&mdash;thereof!"
</p>

<p>
The evil?
</p>

<p>
Might it come to that for Lauraine, and for himself!
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"My dear," says Lady Etwynde to Lauraine, as she
sits in the boudoir of the latter, "your roses looked
charming; there was something so simple and artistic
in that arrangement; not like a regular florist's bouquet.
But why did you leave them in the garden?  I found
them lying on the grass when I walked there this morning,
and as I love roses, though they have not the subtle
meaning of our own peculiar flowers, I brought them in
and put them in water."
</p>

<p>
Lauraine flushes hotly, and then grows as suddenly pale.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I dropped them, I suppose," she says, bending
over some crewels she is sorting.  "It is of no
consequence.  I get so many flowers."
</p>

<p>
Lady Etwynde glances quickly at the beautiful,
troubled face.  She has taken a warm liking to Lauraine,
and when alone with her drops all her fantastic ways
and conversation.  She leans back now in her low chair,
and looks long and thoughtfully at her friend.
</p>

<p>
"I had not much time to speak to you last night,"
she says presently; "and you left so suddenly.  I was
afraid you were ill."
</p>

<p>
"Oh no&mdash;I was only tired," answers Lauraine.  "How
charming your evening was.  I rarely hear such music
as at your house."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; Signor Alfieri was delightful," agrees Lady
Etwynde.  "Did you like his new song, by the way?"
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean the English one?" asks Lauraine,
feeling an odd little thrill at her heart as she remembers
the passionate melody which had so moved and stirred
her.  "It was perfectly exquisite."
</p>

<p>
"I wrote him the words," says Lady Etwynde calmly.
</p>

<p>
"<i>You!</i>" exclaims Lauraine, in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Not that I believe in such sentiments," continues
her friend, smiling.  "For the matter of that, I suppose
no poet is quite idiot enough to believe what he writes,
unless they are things like the 'Boudoir Ballads.'  But
it sounds well to talk of love being all in all, though no
one believes it is&mdash;or, indeed, wants it to be.  Moonlight
and kisses are all very well, but we want some more
substantial food in life than that."
</p>

<p>
"You don't believe in love, then?" questions Lauraine.
</p>

<p>
"Not much.  I have outlived that faith.  Most
women do.  At sixteen, you know, we believe in all men;
at twenty in <i>one</i>; at thirty in none.  I believe in none.
I have given myself up to the pleasures of the mind, and
they suit me much better.  I am a disciple of culture."
</p>

<p>
"I know," smiles Lauraine.  "But you might find
a kindred spirit even there.  What then?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I have not much fear of that," says Lady
Etwynde gravely.  "You see, the men I meet and
associate with are more or less hobby-riders.  They each
have a special subject, and devote themselves to it&mdash;almost
too much so, in fact.  But I suppose it is difficult
to draw the line.  A fair and adequate amount of culture
is delightful, but it leads people on to wild lengths
sometimes.  I am wondering in my own mind how far
the desire for its acquisition will lead me.  Still, one must
have some object in life&mdash;especially if one is a woman
and not married; and I shall never be that."
</p>

<p>
"Why is it so improbable?" asks Lauraine.
</p>

<p>
"Why?  Oh, because I don't care for such a prosaic
termination to my liberty for one thing, and I don't
believe in men for another.  And society&mdash;society as it is
now&mdash;has really very little interest for me.  It bores me,
in point of fact.  All the same, my dear, the men I meet
and whose society I cultivate are not at all the sort of
men to inspire romantic sentiments&mdash;do you think so?"
</p>

<p>
"Candidly, I do not," smiles Lauraine.
</p>

<p>
"And as a woman&mdash;however hard she strives to cultivate
her mental power&mdash;must also have some outlet for the
weaker and more sentimental portion of her nature, I
take refuge in writing poetry.  It is very safe, and does
no one either good or harm, which is more than we can
say of some of our modern poets.  I have never shaped
my actions by what people think or believe, and I am
not going to begin now.  I am called eccentric, but I
would rather be that than commonplace.  You, now, are
very different.  You are full to the brim with romance,
and you still believe in 'moonlight and kisses.'
Unfortunately, I can't preach a mission to you, for you are
married; and as for art and culture, well, your position
demands incessant sacrifices, and the higher good must
suffer.  Perhaps, after all, it is best to live for the life
about one, not some abstract thing that only has interest
for a few.  The one owns a wider range of sympathy,
and has at least the advantage of being understood."
</p>

<p>
"I think no amount of learning or mental culture&mdash;to
use your favourite expression&mdash;should destroy one's
sympathy with the common joys, and needs, and sorrows
around us," says Lauraine thoughtfully.  "Life has
to be lived; we can't get over that fact, and to shut
ourselves apart in the selfish absorption of one special
idea, and sneer at all who cannot understand or cannot
pause to investigate it, is really a sort of sin against
ourselves and our fellow-beings."
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean that I do that?" asks Lady Etwynde.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no; you have plenty of sympathy even for
those outside the pale of 'culture.'  But a great many
of those who surround and flatter you at your æsthetic
court are the most prejudiced and narrow-minded
individuals it has ever been my lot to meet."
</p>

<p>
"Ah," sighs Lady Etwynde.  "I suppose you are
right&mdash;it is a case of 'a little knowledge is a dangerous
thing.'  I often wonder whether it is best to take life
very seriously, or laugh at it as a good joke."
</p>

<p>
"I should think our own natures could alone make
either case possible," says Lauraine.
</p>

<p>
"But the greatest mistake is to put your heart into
it," continues Lady Etwynde.  "It is like giving a
licence to your friends and enemies alike.  The purely
selfish people are the only class who get any real
enjoyment out of life, after all."
</p>

<p>
"It can scarcely be enjoyment," says Lauraine.
"A life apart from love&mdash;from sympathy&mdash;from the
interests of others&mdash;can never be an entirely happy one,
though it may be in a sense untroubled."
</p>

<p>
"We are having a very grave conversation for a
morning call," says Lady Etwynde; "and it all came
about the flowers.  Was that your own idea, my love?"
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;Keith&mdash;Mr. Athelstone suggested it," Lauraine
answers, with again that burning blush on her
delicate cheek.
</p>

<p>
"You and he are very good friends, I suppose,"
remarks Lady Etwynde, rising to make her adieux.
"But all the same, my dear, I should suggest to him to
get married.  A rich young man knocking about town
is sure to get into mischief.  Yes, he'd be much better
off married, and there's that pretty American
girl&mdash;whatever her name is; you know her, don't
you?&mdash;well, absolutely dying for love of him."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed?" says Lauraine coldly; "I should scarcely
think she was the sort of girl he would admire."
</p>

<p>
"I never said he admired her.  Only I suppose there
was something or other between them in New York.
At least they met there, and her aunt is so awfully thick
with him."
</p>

<p>
"He has never mentioned her name to me," answers
Lauraine, wondering why that sudden, sharp pain is
at her heart&mdash;why the bare idea of Keith Athelstone's
marriage should be so hateful.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!&mdash;well, I suppose there is nothing in it but
talk," says Lady Etwynde.  "You and he are just like
brother and sister.  He would be sure to have told you."
</p>

<p>
Brother and sister!  A hot, shamed flush creeps to
Lauraine's brow, and spreads itself over her face and
down to the milk-white throat.  Brother and sister!&mdash;and
on her lips still burns, and in her heart still lives the
memory of that kiss of last night.
</p>

<p>
Lady Etwynde goes, and Lauraine sits there alone,
and thinks with shame and terror of what she has weakly
yielded&mdash;permission for his visits, his presence, his old
accustomed privileges that the world deems so natural&mdash;that
she knows to be so wrong now.  At the bottom of
her heart lies a bitter contempt of herself and her folly&mdash;it
stings her to hot anger with him&mdash;to a haunting dread
that will ever pursue her.  And yet ... and yet ...

<h3>
CHAPTER X
</h3>

<p>
"My dear Lauraine," says Mrs. Douglas, on one of those
rare occasions when she is at Lauraine's house, "isn't
it rather bad form to have Keith dangling after you so
much?  Of course every one knows you are just like
brother and sister, and Sir Francis is so kind to him and
all that&mdash;still, people will talk, you know, and really
nowadays a woman can't be too careful.  Society is
terribly scandalous."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Douglas has made one of a dinner party at the
Vavasours', and is at present sitting by her daughter's
side in the great flower-scented drawing-room.
</p>

<p>
Lauraine quietly waves the great white fan of feathers
in her hand to and fro, and looks coldly down at her
mother's face.
</p>

<p>
"Who has been good enough to discuss my affairs
with you?" she asks, scornfully.
</p>

<p>
"Pray don't be offended," says Mrs. Douglas, timidly.
"People will talk, you know, and really Keith's adoration
is very obvious.  He never even seems to see there
is another woman in the room when you are by.  It
really is not fair to you.  Why doesn't he marry that
Yankee girl who is always running after him?  It
would be the best thing he could do."
</p>

<p>
"I will ask him if you wish," says Lauraine; "or perhaps
it might be better if you put the question yourself."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Douglas feels decidedly uncomfortable.  "I
am only speaking for your good," she says.  "For your
child's sake you ought to be careful.  Of course, Society
is very lax, and women can do things nowadays that in
my youth would have been thought disreputable.
Still, you make yourself quite too remarkable about
Keith.  It is far better to have twenty men dangling
after you than one."
</p>

<p>
A hot flush burns on Lauraine's cheeks.  "I decline
to discuss my affairs with any one," she says, coldly.
"I am perfectly well able to take care of myself."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, people always think that," says Mrs. Douglas,
fanning herself leisurely.  "Of course you are your own
mistress now, and can do as you please.  I simply give
you a hint.  People will talk, you know."
</p>

<p>
Lauraine's heart beat quickly, stormily, beneath its
shrouding laces.  A new trouble seems dawning for her,
and yet it but rouses in her heart a fierce desire to brave
the world&mdash;to laugh to scorn its whispers.  Is she
not strong?  Has she not honour&mdash;courage&mdash;fidelity?
</p>

<p>
"I will not affect to misunderstand you," she says at
last, looking calmly into her mother's face as she speaks.
"You think Keith might forget&mdash;or I?  But you might
know us better than that.  We are not likely to
scandalize Society&mdash;be at rest on that point.  Is it not
possible for a woman and a man to care for each other
without love, and without&mdash;shame?"
</p>

<p>
"Possible?&mdash;that <i>may</i> be," said Mrs. Douglas.  "But
probable&mdash;I think not.  I don't believe in Platonics when
a man is under sixty and a woman not forty-five.  Nor
does the world.  Take my advice, dear&mdash;there is safety
in numbers&mdash;don't think only of the attractions of
one."
</p>

<p>
"I am not the sort of woman to make many friends,"
Lauraine answers, tranquilly.  "And the few I really
like are more to me than the whole crowd of others.
But your warning was quite unnecessary, mother, and I
think you had very little right to utter it."
</p>

<p>
She rises from her seat as she speaks and goes towards
the other end of the room, where the Lady Jean sits
radiant and entertaining, being one of the few wise
women who take as much pains to conciliate their own
sex, as to charm the other.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Douglas looks after her uneasily.  "I have done
no good," she thinks.  "Perhaps only harm.  But,
after all, she is warned, and really it is quite too
ridiculous to think he can hang about her for ever.  I thought
he would have had more sense.  And she has been
married two years&mdash;he ought to have forgotten by this
time.  As for Lauraine herself, she was always so romantic,
I don't blame her so much; but Keith&mdash;and what on
earth can she see in him except that he has long
eyelashes?  I always thought him quite stupid myself,
and Lauraine has mind enough of her own to like
cleverness in other people.  But I do hope she won't
get talked about.  It would be altogether too dreadful.
There is Lady Jean, now&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Her reflections are cut short here&mdash;a robe of amber silk
seems to float past like a pale gold cloud, and disperse
itself over the low chair and Ambusson carpet by her
side.  Emerging pale and languid from amidst the
cloudy draperies is the face of the Lady Etwynde.
Mrs. Douglas greets her eagerly.  It is rarely indeed that
conventional gatherings like the present are graced
by the presence of the lovely æsthete.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; I make an exception in favour of Lady
Vavasour," she says, in her soft, plaintive voice, that
seems to rebel against the very burden of speech.  "But
Society is not congenial to me.  My tastes and inclinations
move in a very different groove.  Why <i>will</i> people
be frivolous?  Life is not meant for eating and drinking
and scandalmongering.  What can it really matter who
is dressed by Worth, or Pingat, or Elise; or whose
husband ran off with an actress, or whose wife got talked
about at Hurlingham, or anything else of the same sort?
Yet this is all one hears discussed in Society.  Ah, when a
perfect culture has given us a perfect understanding
of the beautiful, we shall also have a truer morality.  The
soul will soar far above the senses, and we shall look
back in wonder at the ignorance we once enjoyed."
</p>

<p>
"No doubt," murmurs Mrs. Douglas, vaguely.  She
is quite unable to comprehend what Lady Etwynde
means, but it would never do to let her perceive it.
</p>

<p>
"We shall be translated&mdash;advanced, as it were,"
continues Lady Etwynde, dreamily.  "We shan't tie
back our gowns, and impede the action of our limbs.
We shan't cramp our bodies into the machinery of bones
and wires, that gives us that most odious of modern
inventions&mdash;a 'waist.'  We shall languish no longer for
happiness and occupation.  Our minds will soar into
purer ether.  Ah! happy days that I see in the dim
future, and yearn for in the mists of present darkness."
</p>

<p>
"Exactly," again asserts Mrs. Douglas, in increasing
bewilderment.  "But don't you think 'waists' are very
much admired?"  She possesses a very elegant figure
of her own, and has her corsets made by a special French
artist.  It therefore brings no thrill of blissful
expectation to her that advanced civilization preludes such
an abolition as "stays."
</p>

<p>
"Admired!" murmurs the Lady Etwynde, dreamily.
"By the Philistines&mdash;yes; by the thoughtful&mdash;the
advanced&mdash;the intense&mdash;oh, no!"
</p>

<p>
"The Philistines!" says Mrs. Douglas, in growing
bewilderment.  "I&mdash;I thought corsets were not
introduced till the time of Queen Elizabeth."
</p>

<p>
The Lady Etwynde smiles sadly.  "You do not
understand&mdash;it is merely a technical term for those
outside the pale.  Progress and culture mean
enlightenment&mdash;we all need to be enlightened.  Our individual
tendencies are hampered by social restrictions.  But
the soul will find its wings and soar above such paltry
barriers.  Women will take their place in the ranks
of the advanced, and the mockers at progress will have
to recognize its truth, and feel that it is a law powerful
enough to sway the whole machinery of civilization,
and lift it upwards to a grander and loftier life."
</p>

<p>
"Good Heavens! what a dreadful woman," thinks
Mrs. Douglas.  "I&mdash;I have not thought much of such things,"
she says aloud.  "I am not a clever woman, like
yourself, dear Lady Etwynde.  But I really think we are
very happy as we are.  What good can progress do?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" sighs Lady Etwynde.  "The old cry of the
world&mdash;the battle-cry of the human race, that is ever so
obstinately opposed to its own good.  When we cease
to oppose, and investigate instead&mdash;when prejudice and
obstinacy give way to thoughtfulness and consideration,
then some proper basis will have been obtained on which
to establish the glories of Progress, and the sublimity of
Culture."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Douglas feels too hopelessly bewildered after
this speech to pursue the subject.  She gives a sigh,
and resigns herself to incomprehensibility; but the
entrance of the gentlemen makes a slight disturbance,
and the Lady Etwynde lapses into thought.  Unknown
to each other, both of them are watching the same man&mdash;the
tall, well-knit figure of Keith Athelstone.  He stands
a little apart from the group; his face is very grave and
very pale.  There are dark shadows like a bruise under
his eyes, and the drooped lids hide their expression.
Perhaps it is as well.  They are eyes more given to
reveal than to conceal.  The other men draw nearer
to the dazzling groups of silk and satin and lace.  Some
one goes to the piano, and begins to play.  Through the
open window a faint breeze steals, and, weighted with
perfume, floats through the soft-lighted rooms.
</p>

<p>
"He only looks at <i>her</i>," sighs Lady Etwynde.
</p>

<p>
"Why doesn't the silly boy go and talk to some of
those women?" Mrs. Douglas says to herself angrily.
"Does he really care for her still?  How absurd!
And how ill he looks&mdash;as if he hadn't slept for weeks;
but perhaps that's dissipation.  He's sure to have his
full share of it now."
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Keith stands there absorbed and grave.
He has not spoken to Lauraine all the evening.  He is
wondering whether he might seek her now&mdash;whether her
duties as hostess will permit her to give five minutes
to him.  But even as he thinks it, he lifts his eyes,
and meets a signal from the gracefully waving fan of the
Lady Etwynde.  He has no choice but to cross the room
and take the seat by her side.
</p>

<p>
"We have been discussing Progress," she says,
with that exquisite smile of hers lighting her face
like moonlight as she looks at him.  "I was saying
women spoil themselves by their dress nowadays.
It is too elaborate&mdash;too overdone.  Lauraine is one of
the few women who can dress perfectly.  But then she
has taste and artistic feeling."
</p>

<p>
"It is not every one who could dare to copy the
Lady Etwynde," Keith says, with an admiring glance
at the amber clouds that seem to float round the graceful
figure of his companion.  "And to one who dresses
as she does, all other women must look only 'clothed.'"
</p>

<p>
"A distinction with a difference," says Lady Etwynde.
"You pay compliments very gracefully.  That is a
rare thing nowadays."
</p>

<p>
"You are very good to flatter me," answers Keith.
"What I said was scarcely a compliment.  How
handsome Lady Jean Salomans looks to-night!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," answers his companion, giving a rapid glance
from under her languid lids in the direction indicated.
</p>

<p>
Lady Jean is sitting on an ottoman, with a maze of
hothouse blossoms as a background for her brilliant
beauty, and wears a dress of corn-coloured satin, with
scarlet poppies gleaming here and there.  Sir Francis
is standing beside her, and looking down with unmistakable
admiration at the animated face and brilliant eyes.
</p>

<p>
Involuntarily Keith's glance turns from her to
Lauraine.  What a contrast!
</p>

<p>
"Like a sunflower and a lily," murmurs the Lady
Etwynde, following that glance and comprehending it.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he says, quietly.  "They are very unlike.
One would scarcely expect the same man to admire both."
</p>

<p>
"Sir Francis has been more than two years married,"
says Lady Etwynde, musingly.  "Time enough, I
suppose, to admire other people besides his own wife.
Why will women marry?  It is such a mistake!"
</p>

<p>
"Why will they marry the wrong man, is more to the
point," Keith mutters under his thick moustache.
"Heavens, what ill-assorted matches one does see!"
</p>

<p>
"True," replies "the Ladye."  "Scarcely made in
heaven, I suppose you think?"
</p>

<p>
"In a very different place, it is my candid opinion."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Douglas has risen ere this and moved away.
She is never comfortable in Keith Athelstone's presence,
and is only too thankful when she can evade him.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," says Lady Etwynde.  "It is sad, but true,
that much of the unhappiness of life is caused
voluntarily&mdash;the proofs of our own unwisdom.  Of course,
results are always unforeseen.  We only grope in the
dark.  But, for my part, I have never heard of people
acting for what they term 'the best' without dire
misfortunes following."
</p>

<p>
Keith's eyes seem to travel down the long rooms to
where one shimmering white robe trails in fleecy folds.
</p>

<p>
His heart aches bitterly as he thinks of what "acting for
the best" has brought upon two lives that might have
been so happy now.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Oh, the little more, and how much it is, and the little
less&mdash;and what worlds away!</i>"
</p>

<p>
He talks on with Lady Etwynde in desultory fashion.
He knows he need not exert himself to be entertaining
here.  She likes a good listener&mdash;one who can be
interested in her ideas and follow them, and with Keith
Athelstone, as with Lauraine, she lays her art jargon aside.
Yet in his heart he longs for one sound of Lauraine's
voice&mdash;for just five minutes by her side.
</p>

<p>
They have not met since the scene in Lady Etwynde's
garden, and to-night her greeting has been of the coldest
description.  But he dares not go over to her now,
as he would have done a few days ago.  He sits there,
contenting himself with an occasional glance, and
listening patiently, if a little wearily, to the beautiful
æsthete's discussion.  Then Lauraine looks across at
him and smiles.  His heart seems to warm beneath that
sign of remembrance&mdash;his whole face changes.  Lady
Etwynde notices it, and grows troubled.
</p>

<p>
"He is in love, and he does not conceal it&mdash;poor
boy," she thinks, compassionately.  "Ah, I always
thought those fraternal arrangements were a great
imposition.  One or other is sure to ask or desire that
'little more' which just makes all the difference.
Ah! it is worlds enough away from these two.  Does she
know, I wonder?  I think not.  She could not act that
serenity and indifference.  She is too transparent.  Oh,
I hope she does not suspect.  It would be terrible
indeed.  She is so young and beautiful, but she is not happy.
Any one can see that; and her husband is always running
after that brazen woman over there.  Dear me, how sad
life is.  Full of contradictions&mdash;of pain.  Mr. Athelstone,"
she adds aloud, "I want to speak to that gentleman over
there.  He is a <i>savant</i> of the most advanced school.
Kindly give me your arm."
</p>

<p>
Keith rises and obeys, and comes now within the radiance
of the floating white draperies that have been before
his eyes the whole night long.

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
</h3>

<p>
Lauraine is talking to an elderly man&mdash;a colonel in the
Guards.  She neither looks up, nor moves, but she is
perfectly, painfully conscious that Keith is standing by
her side.  She knows that he has crossed the room,
and left Lady Etwynde with her <i>savant</i>, and all the time
she has not lifted an eyelid, or stirred from that listening
attitude.  Keith stands there patiently.  He has the
happy knack of looking always graceful, and to-night he
looks handsomer than ever, despite the pallor of his face,
the dark shadows under his eyes.  The Colonel talks on,
and Lauraine answers animatedly.
</p>

<p>
Keith wonders if any memory is at work within her
heart&mdash;if her light words and smiles are real or acted.
</p>

<p>
There is a little stir at the other end of the room.
Some one is going to recite&mdash;a French count, who is a
friend of Sir Francis'.  The elderly colonel is a little deaf.
He murmurs an apology, and moves down the long suite
of rooms.  Keith comes quietly forward, and drops into
the vacant chair.  For the first time Lauraine looks at him.
With one rapid, comprehensive glance, she takes in the
change in his face&mdash;the dark shadows under those heavy
lashes, the weariness upon the brow, the stern sadness
of the mouth.  Pity, sympathy, grief&mdash;all well up
in her heart and speak in her glance, but her lips are
schooled to rigid silence.  She dares not seem to notice
these signs of suffering.
</p>

<p>
"If he would only leave me&mdash;if he would only be
wise!" she thinks, with a sudden passionate dread.
"I could bear that, but to go on like this is madness."
</p>

<p>
He speaks at last.  "London grows unbearably hot.
I suppose you will soon be leaving?" he says.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," answers Lauraine, unconcernedly.  "Sir
Francis talks of going yachting."
</p>

<p>
"And you accompany him?"
</p>

<p>
"I?  Oh, no&mdash;I hate the sea.  I shall go to Falcon's
Chase.  I long for a little quiet and rest.  I never cared
much for fashionable life, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Does Sir Francis make up a large party?"
</p>

<p>
"I believe so.  The Salomans, I know, are going;
and Marc Vandeleur, his great friend; and the Chesters,
and one or two boating men."
</p>

<p>
"The Salomans?" questions Keith, a note of surprise
in his voice.  "Oh, they go, do they?"
</p>

<p>
"Why not?" asks Lauraine, looking at him in
wonder.  "They are very fond of the sea&mdash;at least,
Lady Jean is."
</p>

<p>
"So I suppose," he says in the same peculiar way,
marvelling if Lauraine is really the only woman in
London Society who does not&mdash;know?
</p>

<p>
But Lauraine asks the question in perfect good faith.
She does not like Lady Jean, but she knows no harm of
her.  She detests scandal so utterly that she never
listens to boudoir gossip and five o'clock tea talk, if she
can possibly help it.  To her Lady Jean is simply a
fascinating woman of the world&mdash;very handsome, very
brilliant, very much admired; a little <i>risquée</i>, perhaps,
but on good terms with the most exclusive of great
"sets," and received everywhere.  That her husband
should admire her, and show his preference openly,
in no way disturbs her.  To be jealous one must
love passionately, and Lauraine has never loved her
husband at all.
</p>

<p>
"Why do you speak like that?" she asks him suddenly.
"Don't you like Lady Jean?"
</p>

<p>
"Like her?  I have scarcely the honour to know her
at all," answers Keith.  "But if you wish to know the
truth, I am unfortunate enough to have formed a
prejudice against her.  She gives me the idea of being
false.  I should not like you to make a friend of her."
</p>

<p>
"A friend!" exclaims Lauraine, quickly.  "I should
never think of doing that.  I am not the sort of woman
who can't exist without a confidant&mdash;some one to
'gush' to and consult, and be constantly with.  But
Lady Jean is very charming, and has been very kind to me,
and Sir Francis wished me to show her every attention."
</p>

<p>
A little hard smile comes to Keith Athelstone's lips.
"You are very obedient," he says.
</p>

<p>
Lauraine colours, and is silent.  Meanwhile, at the
further end of the room, with her yellow skirts and
blood-red poppies gleaming in the lamplight, Lady Jean and
Sir Francis Vavasour are talking confidentially together.
</p>

<p>
"Why must he come?" asks Sir Francis, drawing his
dark brows together in a heavy frown.  "You could
manage it if you wished."
</p>

<p>
"Manage it?" re-echoes Lady Jean.  "<i>Cher ami</i>,
what can't a woman manage when she wishes?  But I
don't wish to manage it.  I don't care to be talked about
as we should be.  Of course Jo would do anything I
wished, but I know what's best, and mean to stick to my
first resolution."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Salomans rejoices in the name of "Joel," but his
wife has long ago decreed that it shall not be used by
her lips, and "Jo" he always is and always will be.
</p>

<p>
"You will spoil all the pleasure of the trip for me,"
murmurs Sir Francis.
</p>

<p>
"Chut!" she says, contemptuously; "don't be
foolish.  You can grow sentimental on the waters of the
Mediterranean while you think of your absent wife."
</p>

<p>
"My wife," mutters Sir Francis, following the rapid
gesture of the fan.  "Oh, there's that young fool again.
I wonder he isn't tired of her; she's insufferably stupid."
</p>

<p>
"Most good women are," agrees Lady Jean; "but
they have one incomparable advantage&mdash;they are so
safe.  You can always get amusement, you know,
from other men's wives&mdash;it is a consolation to think the
'other' men can't get it from yours."
</p>

<p>
Sir Francis feels a little twinge.  He knows perfectly
well what she wishes to convey, but he has an obstinate
conviction that Keith's attentions to his wife
are nothing to her, that whatever <i>tendresse</i> there is,
lies on the side of the young man.  Lauraine is cold
and calm and uninteresting&mdash;he has made up his mind
to those facts.  Lady Jean has not yet been able to
stimulate his tired passion for his wife into emitting one
spark of jealous fire.  He has tired of her, but he has
great trust in her.  He never fears that a breath of
scandal will hover about her, and to all Lady Jean's
hints he turns a deaf ear&mdash;as yet.
</p>

<p>
"I often wonder what made you marry," says Lady
Jean, under cover of the music that has followed the
recitation; "and she seems so unlike the sort of woman
who would tempt you into such a folly."
</p>

<p>
"You are right; it was a folly," mutters Sir Francis,
moodily.  "But I was mad about her at the time, and,
after all, one must marry some time or other; it is a
necessity when you have property and all that."
</p>

<p>
"Mad about her!" sneers Lady Jean.  "How like a
man!  You could stop at nothing, of course, but the
absolute possession of your fancied toy.  And your craze
has lasted two years!  Admirable fidelity!"
</p>

<p>
"It would never have been a craze at all," whispers
Sir Francis low in her ear, "if you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hush!" she says, softly; "I have forbidden you
to speak of that.  It would have been different if we had
met&mdash;earlier.  As it is&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She ends the sentence with a sigh.  It may mean
anything, and is poetic; it sounds better than to say,
"As you are quite as rich as Joel Salomans, and are of
better birth and family, I would have taken you instead."  Sir
Francis hears only the sigh, and meets a glance from
the dark, brilliant eyes.
</p>

<p>
"As it is you are cruel," he whispers, passionately.
</p>

<p>
"Cruel to be kind," she says, with a little mocking
laugh.  "Keep to your pearl of purity, <i>mon cher</i>.  If
you are not a jealous husband, you might surely be
a faithful one."
</p>

<p>
"Have I not told you she bores me?" says Sir
Francis, petulantly.  "And I know she detests me, and
always did.  I did not mind that&mdash;once.  Now&mdash;well,
one can't be always at a one-sided adoration."
</p>

<p>
"Fancy 'adoring' any one!  How odd!" laughs Lady
Jean.  "I thought it was only in novels men did that."
</p>

<p>
"Have you never loved then?"
</p>

<p>
Lady Jean raised her arched eyebrows, and looks
at him with admirable amusement.  "I?&mdash;most
decidedly not.  Should I be without wrinkles at my age,
if I had?  <i>Non, merci</i>.  I never believed in such folly,
and never perpetrated it."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps only because the right teacher was not at hand
to give you the lesson," says Sir Francis, audaciously.
</p>

<p>
"The right teacher," says Lady Jean, with a little
mocking laugh.  "There is no such teacher for me, my
dear Sir Francis.  I can defy fate."
</p>

<p>
"I wish you would tell me how," says Sir Francis.
"The recipe might be useful."
</p>

<p>
"You have had your attack of fever, so you are safe,"
she answers, laughingly.  "No, my recipe is too valuable
to be parted with.  Now, you have talked to me long
enough to-night.  Go away and entertain some one else."
</p>

<p>
"I don't want to talk to any one else," says Sir
Francis, doggedly.  "Why do you send me away?
You are not afraid of Mrs. Grundy, surely?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh no.  She and I are the best of friends.  Afraid?&mdash;well,
I don't think I have any need to be afraid.  Every
one is talked about nowadays&mdash;either for what they do
or what they don't do.  And it is so much easier to say a
thing than disprove it.  It is just like a lovely
complexion&mdash;every one can say you paint, but every one can't
see you wash your face.  Society never believes in the
lovely complexion, and yet wouldn't enter a dressing-room
if it could, for fear of finding there was nothing
but&mdash;soap and water&mdash;after all!"
</p>

<p>
"But all this is no reason why I am to go away
now," complains Sir Francis, sulkily.
</p>

<p>
"Can't you trace the analogy?  I don't want to make
your pretty wife jealous.  I don't want people to
talk.  I&mdash;I don't want to give you a monopoly of my
company.  These are reasons enough, surely."
</p>

<p>
"Your reasons are admirable&mdash;all except the first.
Lauraine jealous!  You might as well expect the Venus
of Milo to come down from its pedestal, and walk
through a modern drawing-room."
</p>

<p>
"Marriage does not seem an attractive <i>menu</i> after all,
does it?" says Lady Jean, musingly.  "Two years,
and you have done with the olives and sweetmeats,
and come to the plain ungarnished <i>rôti</i>.  The <i>rôti</i> is
much more wholesome, though."
</p>

<p>
"I believe every man who marries comes to the
conclusion he has made a d&mdash;&mdash;d mistake."
</p>

<p>
"And every woman, too," agrees Lady Jean, quickly.
"Well, it's not to be wondered at.  Difference of feeling
makes a wide gulf between two natures; and where
do you find two people likely to get on together for a
lifetime?  Bah&mdash;it is impossible!  Now go&mdash;go&mdash;I
have talked to you quite enough, and the music is
over.  I am going to chat with Lady Etwynde.  She
amuses me, and it is rarely any one does that
nowadays."
</p>

<p>
Sir Francis takes himself off obediently, and the
evening goes on as such evenings usually do.  There is
music and singing and conversation, and the people
who get next the people they like, are content enough,
and those who are wrongly paired are indescribably bored,
and the beautiful hostess moves like a slender white lily
among them all, and two blue eyes watch her with an
intenser "yearning" than ever the Lady Etwynde
or her friends have experienced for the subtle&mdash;the
infinite&mdash;the sublime.
</p>

<p>
Lauraine is growing very weary of this life she leads.
There seems no possible escape from it, and fashion,
in its way, is just as fatiguing as the work-room,
or the factory, or the office.  There are times now when
she longs to be away from the roar of noisy streets,
to breathe cool fresh air, to be alone with the peace and
loveliness of nature, to have just&mdash;<i>rest</i>.
</p>

<p>
There is no such thing to be found here.  Every
day, almost every hour, has its occupations.  The jargon,
the laughter, the scandals and frivolities of Society are
alike distasteful; but she cannot evade them, be she
ever so weary.  She stands in the ranks, and must needs
move onward in the hot and hurried march.
</p>

<p>
She is counting the days now before it will all be
over&mdash;before she can fly to quiet Falcon's Chase, and in her
child and her books find companionship more to her taste.
She longs for those dark old forest lands, where the noise
of the sea echoes always, and everything is grand and
noble, and rich with the traditions of past ages.  She
does not dread solitude, but rather longs for it.  All this
feverish unrest will be over then.  She need have no
house party till the autumn, but she is going to take
Lady Etwynde with her.  There is something
harmonious and tranquil about her that will suit the
dim old Chase, with its great dusky chambers, and
magnificent hall, and oak-panelled galleries.  Moving
to and fro among her guests, and talking the pretty
frothy nothings that Society demands, Lauraine thinks
only of this.  The longing is taking absolute possession
of her, and Keith will not be able to follow her&mdash;there.
</p>

<p>
She feels a dread&mdash;almost a dislike to him to-night.
The memory of that scene a few days ago fills her
with a sense of intolerable shame, and her mother's
warning sounds like an added insult.
</p>

<p>
A sense of irritation&mdash;of impatience&mdash;of disappointment
is heavy at her heart.
</p>

<p>
"He is not good, or honourable, or he would not stay,"
she says to herself, as move where she may, the sadness
of those eyes, with their watchful entreaty, haunts her.
"Why did I let him persuade me to utter that word?"
</p>

<p>
The guests leave&mdash;the great rooms are solitary.
Sir Francis goes off to finish the evening somewhere else.
Lauraine seats herself wearily by one of the open
windows, and looks out at the foliage of the Park&mdash;all
dry, and sere, and dusty now, with the long drought
and heat of summer.  She looks and looks, and great tears
gather in her eyes and roll slowly down her cheeks.
She has everything that the world counts worth having&mdash;she
is young and beautiful and courted and flattered;
but for all that her heart aches&mdash;aches&mdash;aches.
</p>

<p>
"It was impossible then&mdash;it is doubly impossible now,"
she says, wearily.  "Sin&mdash;shame&mdash;misery&mdash;whichever
way I look at it.  Oh, God help me&mdash;what am I to do?"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
</h3>

<p>
Falcon's Chase is apt to be considered somewhat
dreary and dull by those members of the fashionable
world who only exist to kill time, and see no beauty in
Nature's handiwork.
</p>

<p>
But to Lauraine the whole place is beautiful beyond
words.  The great dark forest lands that shelter the deer in
their coverts, the old bridle-paths, where the boughs meet
overhead, the solemn, stately old mansion itself,
shut in by elm-woods and mighty oaks of centenarian
growth, the stillness and solitude and repose
that breathe everywhere, these have for her an exceeding
charm, an ever-varying delight.  For days and days
she does nothing but wander about, sometimes alone,
sometimes with Lady Etwynde.
</p>

<p>
The weather is mild and the sky is grey and soft.
The keen, salt air of the sea braces and refreshes her tired
frame, and languid spirits.  Her friend is enchanted
with the place, and throws æstheticism to the winds
and goes about in a neat tailor-made gown of homespun,
and abolishes the nimbus around her fair head, and
evinces an energy and alertness that would astonish
her admirers of the "lilies-and-languor" class.
</p>

<p>
One closing evening they stand on the summit of
the great cliffs, at whose base a wild sea is breaking
tempestuously.  A wilder sky is above their heads, one
that foretells a storm close at hand.
</p>

<p>
Lauraine turns her face seaward, and the fierce wind
and dashing spray seem to give it a new and wonderful
beauty.  "It is glorious!" she murmurs, as she stands
there in a sort of rapture.  "It seems as if one could
move, breathe, be free in a place like this."
</p>

<p>
"Free?" says Lady Etwynde.  "Is any one that?
As long as life shackles our souls, so long does bondage
curb our wishes.  I never met a single person, man or
woman, who could do exactly as they wished."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you have not much to complain of," laughs
Lauraine.  "You live as you like, do what you like,
go where you like, and have no domestic responsibilities."
</p>

<p>
"True," says her friend, with sudden gravity, "yet
for all that I have felt a pang of envy sometimes when I
have seen a poor beggar-woman in the streets press her
child to her breast, and look with real love at its poor,
pale, wizened face."
</p>

<p>
"What a confession for a disciple of Culture&mdash;one
who has educated her eyes and taste to such perfection
that a <i>criante</i> bit of furniture, a false tone of colour,
a mistaken arrangement of draperies, will torture her
as a discordant note tortures the ear of a musician!  So
you haven't outlived feminine weakness yet, my dear?"
</p>

<p>
"I suppose Nature always exacts her rights from us
at some period or another," answers Lady Etwynde.
"I have become accustomed to hear I am passionless
and cold, and find it less trouble to live up to the
character than to deny it.  People are always so sure they
know us better than we know ourselves.  Being a single
woman, it is rather a comfort to have such a reputation,
and as I dislike men, and patronize fools, I am safe."
</p>

<p>
"But you are not cold-hearted at all," says Lauraine,
turning her face, with its beautiful sea-kissed bloom,
to that lovely languid one of her æsthetic friend.
"Don't you really care to marry?"
</p>

<p>
"What should I gain?" asks Lady Etwynde, tranquilly.
"<i>Le mieux est l'ennemi du bien</i>, you know.
I am very well off.  I can do pretty much&mdash;not exactly&mdash;as
I please.  I have no one to control me, or consult.
I can follow my own whims and vagaries.  Am I not
well enough?"
</p>

<p>
"And yet you envied the beggar-woman?"
</p>

<p>
"That was in one of those moments when Nature
was whispering at my heart.  Nothing touches me like a
child's sorrow or love.  I have often longed to adopt one,
but&mdash;well, I suppose the <i>feeling</i> would not be there?"
</p>

<p>
"You might marry for&mdash;love," suggests Lauraine.
</p>

<p>
"My dear," murmurs her friend, with delicate scorn
and faint reproach, "at thirty years of age?"
</p>

<p>
"That is not old for a beautiful woman," says
Lauraine, with unconscious but most sincere flattery.
"And it is our natures that make us old, I think,
more than actual years."
</p>

<p>
Lady Etwynde smiles her pensive, moonlit smile.
</p>

<p>
"I shall never love," she says, calmly.  "Men are so
uninteresting; and, besides, people always seem so
unhappy when they are married."
</p>

<p>
Lauraine colours hotly, and her eyes turn seaward.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she says in a low voice.  "The people we
know and meet&mdash;in Society.  But to them marriage
has been chiefly a matter of arrangement, or convenience.
There is not often any <i>heart</i> in it."
</p>

<p>
"And if there were it would not last," answers Lady
Etwynde.  "Sentiment is lovely in theory; you cannot
reduce it to practice, though."
</p>

<p>
"I think it might be possible," says Lauraine, dreamily.
"Even fashion and the world cannot kill feeling.
If people would only be more true to themselves&mdash;less
artificial, less exaggerated&mdash;they would be much happier."
</p>

<p>
"Doubtless; but far less comfortable!  My dear
Lauraine, Society suits its age, and always has suited it.
It is no use wishing things could be altered."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose not," sighs Lauraine.
</p>

<p>
"You are rather romantic," continues Lady Etwynde,
as they turn back from the great bold headland and
move towards the narrow path that leads into the
woods of Falcon's Chase.  "It is an unfortunate
quality for either man or woman.  They will never see
persons or things as they really are.  They will love,
and invest the person loved with every attribute they
would <i>wish</i> them to possess, and which, alas! they never
do.  They throw a halo of imagination round every head
that is dear to them.  Their existence is a series of
shocks and disappointments.  They see their fairy
weapons broken time after time in the world's rough
warfare.  They stand and look at life with wistful,
feverish eyes, praying, 'Be as I fancy you,' and it never
will.  They break their hearts over the sufferings and
sorrows they see, and intensify their own by too keen a
sympathy.  They are never understood, especially by
those they love the best.  They are like the poets who
sing to deaf ears and go through life misunderstood,
even if not scorned, and not ridiculed."
</p>

<p>
"What makes you think I am romantic?"
</p>

<p>
"A thousand things.  Your love of nature and solitude,
your artistic fancies, your emotional capacity, your
extreme sensitiveness.  I have a weakness for studying
character.  When I first saw you I said to myself:
'She is not happy.'  'She is full of idealities.'  'She
cares nothing for the world.'  'She will not be content
only to&mdash;live.'  Am I right, or not?"
</p>

<p>
"Can one ever know oneself quite?" murmurs
Lauraine, colouring softly.  "Do you really think I am
not&mdash;happy?"
</p>

<p>
"Think!  It scarcely needs consideration.  But I
am not going to encourage you in morbid sentiment.
I do not think you are a weak woman.  I hope not.
But I fancy you will need all your strength at some time
in your life."
</p>

<p>
"You talk like a sibyl.  Do you possess the gift of
second sight in addition to your other accomplishments?"
laughs Lauraine.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think so.  It only needs a little thought,
a mental trick of putting two and two together, to read
most characters.  Of course there is a great deal of
mediocrity to be met with, and yet it is surprising how
widely even mediocrities differ when you give yourself
the trouble of analysing them.  Human nature is like
a musical instrument&mdash;there are but few notes, seven
in all&mdash;but look at what volumes of melody have been
written on those notes."
</p>

<p>
"And, to pursue your metaphor, what a difference
in the sound of the keys to each individual touch:
some give back but a dull thud; others a rich, full,
resonant sound, full of life and melody."
</p>

<p>
"True, and therein lies the danger for many natures.
The master-hand that produces the highest order of
melody is perhaps too often that of some passing stranger
who goes carelessly by&mdash;and who, so to speak, finds
the instrument open&mdash;runs his hands lightly over the
keys, awakens brilliance, life, beauty, where others
have produced but dull, prosaic sounds, and then goes
away and&mdash;forgets."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, if we were only wood and leather, and had
wire for our strings, not hearts and souls, we should not
miss the player, or sigh for the vanished music," says
Lauraine.  "Unfortunately, forgetfulness is not always
possible for us, desire it as we may."
</p>

<p>
"Have you ever desired it?" asks Lady Etwynde,
quickly.  "Pardon me," she adds, as she notices the
sudden whiteness of the beautiful face.  "I should not
have asked.  But you will not misjudge me, idle
curiosity had nothing to do with the question."
</p>

<p>
"I know that," says Lauraine, quickly.  "Yes, if
there is one thing I desire on earth it is the possibility
of forgetfulness."
</p>

<p>
"The one thing that never comes for trying&mdash;or
seeking&mdash;or praying," murmurs Lady Etwynde,
dreamily.  Alas, those melodies!  A sad day indeed
it is for the woman who confesses&mdash;
</p>

<p>
  'The face of all the world is changed, I think,<br>
  Since first I heard the foot-steps of thy soul.'<br>
</p>

<p>
It is a beautiful idea, is it not?  That is one advantage
of poetry&mdash;it clothes a thought in grace so exquisite
that we feel as if conversing with a being from another
world.  I never can understand people saying they
don't like, or can't comprehend it.  Sense, memory,
love, pleasure, joy, pain, all that is sensitive, emotional,
purest, best, is acted upon and intensified by poetry.
A word, a line, will thrill us to the very core and centre of
our beings&mdash;will make joy more sweet&mdash;-pain less bitter&mdash;love
more exquisite and life less hard, even beneath its
burden of regrets."
</p>

<p>
"You love poetry so much?" questions Lauraine.
</p>

<p>
"More than anything.  But by poetry I don't mean
merely beautiful verses.  I include all grand and
noble thoughts that imagination has coloured, and
that are read as prose.  A really poetic nature is one
that sees beauty in the simplest of created things as
well as in the grandest; that is humble and yet great;
that drinks at every fountain of nature; that steeps
itself in the enchantment of a scene, not measuring
merely the height of a mountain from the sea level, or
dwelling on the possible discomfort of a storm at a
particular altitude; that knows its mind to be full of
longings and yet can only partially satisfy them; that
would fain be glorified, filled, enriched; and, alas! knows
only too well that the wings of the mind are beating
against the prison-bars of a stern and hard existence,
from which escape is only possible in dreams, or&mdash;death!"
</p>

<p>
"Do you not think that such a nature must be intensely
unhappy?"
</p>

<p>
"I said so at the beginning of our conversation.
But still it holds the two extremes that make up
life&mdash;happiness and misery; it gets more out of each than
natures more placid and commonplace and content.
It really lives, and the others&mdash;stagnate."
</p>

<p>
"You must have read a great deal, and thought a
great deal," says Lauraine, looking admiringly up at
her friend's thoughtful face.  "Do you know I think
you are the only woman I have ever met who talks
about other things besides dress and fashion?  I don't
think I ever heard you say a scandalous word of
anybody.  You put me in mind of something a friend of
mine once said, 'Women who are intellectual always
talk of <i>things</i>; women who are shallow, of <i>persons</i>.'  There
is a great deal in that if you come to think
of it.  How wearisome it is to hear of nothing but
'names' in a conversation; and yet I know heaps of
men and women who are considered brilliant and witty
and amusing, and whose whole conversation turns
upon nothing else but gossip respecting other men, or
women."
</p>

<p>
"I quite understand you.  Society is eminently
artificial, and objects to strong emotions, and would
rather not be called upon to feel anything.  'Why <i>will</i>
people go on writing?' said a lady to me one day.
'Everything has been said that can be said.  Literature
is only repetition.'"
</p>

<p>
"'My dear madam,' I told her, 'light is always
light;' but I suppose you will acknowledge there is a
difference between having our streets illuminated with
oil-lamps hung on a rope, or brilliant with gas and
electricity.  Art and science and literature must progress
with their age.  Scott and Fielding and Smollett don't
suit the nineteenth century, any more than perhaps
Braddon, Ouida, and Rhoda Broughton may suit the
twentieth.  Nevertheless, each has had its day and held
its champions, irrespective of what a coming generation
will say on the subject.  The immediate good, excitement,
benefit, is all Society thinks of now.  It has laid
its demands on each respective cycle&mdash;birth, or heroism,
or refined manners, or even mind.  But in our
age it worships the golden calf alone.  <i>You</i> don't
know, and I don't; but all our reward is to be wondered
at, and never to 'get on' with people.  It is Lady
Jean Salomans who 'gets on.'  But then she knows her
age and accepts it, and goes with it.  I dare say, being
a clever woman, she laughs in her sleeve at one set,
and yawns after a prolonged dose of the other; but
she's the most popular woman in London, and there's
something in that more satisfactory nowadays than
in saying: 'I am the Queen of England.'  You and
I will never be 'popular' in her sense, Lauraine,
because we don't take the trouble, or perhaps
appreciate, the reward.  As for you, my dear, you are
too transparent for Society.  You show if you are bored
or pleased, or happy or sad.  That doesn't do.  You
should always go about masked, or you are sure to
offend some one or other.  You are young, and have
been very much admired, and have a splendid position.
Socially you might take the lead of Lady Jean, but you
never will.  You don't care enough about the 'honour
and glory' of social success."
</p>

<p>
"No; it seems to me unutterably wearisome."
</p>

<p>
"Exactly, and you show that you feel it to be so.
I have done the same for long, but then I covered my
dereliction with the cloak of eccentricity.  You simply
do nothing but look like a martyr."
</p>

<p>
"Why will people live and act as if this life was the
be-all and end-all of existence, I wonder?" murmurs
Lauraine.  "Fancy fretting one's soul away in the petty
worries of social distinction, the wretched little triumphs
of Fashion.  To me it seems such an awfully humiliating
waste of time."
</p>

<p>
"You laugh at my enthusiasm for Culture," answers
Lady Etwynde; "but that really is the only way to
reform the abuses that disfigure an age so advanced
and refined as ours.  Invention and science have never
done so much for any period as for this, and yet men
and women shut themselves out from intellectual
pleasures, and demand scarce anything but frivolity,
excitement, and amusement&mdash;not even well-bred amusements
either.  The gold of the millionaire gilds his
vulgarity, and lifts him to the level of princes.  Good
birth and refinement, and purity and simplicity, are
treated as old-fashioned prejudices.  We are all pushing
and scrambling in a noisy bewildering race.  We don't
want to think or to reason, or to be told of our follies
in the present, or of retribution in the future.  Gilt and
gloss is all we ask for, no harsh names for sins, no
unpleasant questioning about our actions.  Ah me! it is
very sad, but it is also very true.  Society is a body
whose members are all at variance as to the good,
and agreed as to the evil.  The passions, the absurdities,
the interests, the relations of life are either
selfishly gratified, or equally selfishly ignored.  It is
not of the greatest good to the greatest number that a
man or woman thinks now; but just the greatest amount
of possible gratification to their respective selves.  With
much that should make this age the most highly-cultured
the world has known, there is, alas! much more that
renders it hopelessly and vulgarly abased."
</p>

<p>
"And there is no remedy?"
</p>

<p>
"My dear, there are many.  But Society hugs its
disease, and cries out at the physic.  It knows of the
cancer, but will not hear of the operator's knife.  Perhaps,
after all, it is right.  Think of the trouble of being
highly bred, highly educated, pure in thought and tone,
sparkling and not vulgar, amusing and yet refined,
dignified yet never offending, proud yet never
contemptuous.  Why, it would be a complete revolution.
Fancy forsaking artifice, living in a real Palace of Truth,
where everything was honest, definite, straightforward!
Think of our poor pretty painted butterflies, forsaking
their rose gardens and beaten by the storms and cold
winds of stern prejudices and honestly-upheld faiths.
Ah, no!  It is simply preaching a crusade against
infidels, who are all the more vindictive in opposition
because civilization, instinct, and reason tell them they
are in the wrong...  Why, here we are almost at the
lodge, and here comes baby to meet us.  Ah, Lauraine,
thank God after all, that we are women.  Would a child's
smile and broken prattle be a volume of such exquisite
poetry to any other living creature?"
</p>

<p>
Two little eager feet are toddling to meet Lauraine,
two tiny arms clasp her neck as she runs forward and
snatches up the little figure.
</p>

<p>
A thrill of sweet, pure joy flies through her heart.
"Heaven has not left me comfortless," she thinks.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  "I have loved," she said,<br>
  "Man is weak&mdash;God is dread."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The child can just run alone now, and lisp his mother's
name in that sweet baby language which is earth's
exquisite music to a mother's ears.  He is a lovely little
fellow, with big starry eyes, and soft gold hair and
winning coaxing ways, which did as they would with all
womankind, who had anything to do with him.
</p>

<p>
Lauraine kneels there for a moment under the great oak
trees, and, holds him clasped to her heart.
</p>

<p>
"We will take him home, nurse," she says, looking
up at the stately personage who is his guardian, and who
adores him with all her soul.
</p>

<p>
"You can't carry him, my lady, and it is too far for
him to walk," she says.
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes.  Lady Etwynde and I will carry him between
us," answers Lauraine.  "Darling&mdash;how strong and
big he gets!  There, take mother's hand.  Isn't he
delighted, Lady Etwynde, to come with us?"
</p>

<p>
"He seems so," smiles her friend.  "Farewell to
philosophy now, Lauraine.  King Baby puts everything
else into the background."
</p>

<p>
"It is wonderful, is it not?" says Lauraine, with
something of the old bright smile.  "I wonder how I
could ever have lived without him.  He seems to hold
all my heart in these two wee hands of his."
</p>

<p>
"I have often wondered," says Lady Etwynde,
dreamily, "it seems an odd thing to say, perhaps, but I
have often wondered at women who are mothers 'going
wrong' as people express it.  I could understand a wife,
bad as it is; but to forsake your children your own
flesh and blood for the sake of a man's love&mdash;well it
must be a sort of delirious frenzy, I suppose.  And do
you know it is not always flighty women&mdash;careless
women&mdash;who astonish us by a <i>daux pas</i>.  It is sometimes the
quietest and most unlikely."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," answers Lauraine very quietly; "these
cases are so totally different to the lookers-on.  They
only see the result, not what leads up to it."
</p>

<p>
"It is difficult to know what to think," says Lady
Etwynde.  "I have known people marry for love, for
money, for rank, for convenience, for obedience's sake,
for duty's sake, and yet I don't know of one single <i>really</i>
happy marriage.  The lovers have got sick of each other
in a year, the moneyed pair are miserable, the other
indifferent, unfaithful, erratic, as the case may be.
Is it any wonder, Lauraine, that I gave the business a
wide berth?"
</p>

<p>
"You are fortunate to be able to please yourself," says
Lauraine; "it is not every woman who can do that."
</p>

<p>
"No, I suppose not," says her friend.  "And then
it's a case of 'what can't be cured, must be endured.'  Is
baby too heavy for you?  Let me carry him now!"
</p>

<p>
"I wonder what makes him shiver so?" says Lauraine,
anxiously.  "I don't think nurse ought to have brought
him out such a cold afternoon."
</p>

<p>
"And we haven't a shawl or wrap of any description,"
says Lady Etwynde.  "Yes he does look cold.  There, I'll
turn his face away from the wind.  We shall soon be
home.  Why, how troubled you look, my dear.  When
you have a nursery full of little plagues, you won't
fidget about one so much."
</p>

<p>
But, despite her cheery words, she hurries on as fast
as her feet can carry her.  The little fellow shivers
constantly during that passage through the avenue, and
glad indeed is she when the ruddy blaze of lights and
fire gleams from the great dark old mansion.
</p>

<p>
"He will soon be warm now," she says, cheerfully
when they reach the house.  Lauraine and herself
take off his hat and coat, and sit down with him before
the great blazing fire in the hall, and chafe his little cold
hands and feet until he crows and laughs, and seems to
have quite recovered himself again.
</p>

<p>
The two women sit there and have tea brought to them,
and administer some to baby, who appreciates it
immensely.  They play games with him, and sing
nursery rhymes, and in fact, have an hour of the simplest,
and perhaps also the purest enjoyment that women can
have.  Then nurse comes, and he is carried off to bed,
flushed, rosy, boisterous, his pretty laughter echoing
down the wide oak staircase, his eyes beaming star-like
down on his mother's face so long as ever she remains
in sight.  When he is fairly gone the two friends
ensconce themselves comfortably before the great fireplace.
</p>

<p>
A footman enters with the post-bag, and hands it to his
mistress.  Lauraine unlocks it, and takes out its contents.
She hands two or three letters to Lady Etwynde, and
glances carelessly at her own.  One, she sees, is from her
husband, the other&mdash;a sudden wave of colour crimsons
her face.  Only too well she knows those bold, clear
characters.  "Why does he write to me?" she thinks,
passionately.  "Can't he even try and let me forget?"
</p>

<p>
Lady Etwynde is absorbed in her own correspondence.
Lauraine hastily tears open the envelope and takes out
two sheets closely covered.  The letter begins without
any preamble, or formal mode of address:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Perhaps I ought not to write to you.  You gave me
no permission to do so before you left town; but, all the
same, I feel I must.  It is only a week since you went
away.  How long a week can be!  I can't make up my
mind where to go.  I have heaps of invitations, but
don't care to accept any of them.  Mrs. Woollffe and
her niece are at Scarborough, they go to Trouville
afterwards.  I may join them.  Despite eccentricities, they
suit me better than English people.  How is the 'Ladye'?
Is she pursuing culture amidst the gloomy grandeur of
Northumbrian shores, and does she bore or entertain
you?  Perhaps it is no use to ask questions, for you
have never promised to write.  Would you do so, I
wonder, if I told you what a great, <i>great</i> pleasure it
would be to me; and I think you know something of the
emptiness of my life.  Do not fancy I am complaining,
or that I wish to excite your pity.  I only leave it to
yourself and your own kind-heartedness, I won't even
plead the old 'boy and girl' claim now.  With you,
Lauraine, I have always felt more as if speaking to myself
in a way&mdash;you have so much comprehension, so much
sympathy.  You know there are few people to whom
we ever open up our <i>real</i> selves and most of us go through
life really strangers to those who think they know us best.
But with you and me this will never be.  We have
stood heart to heart in our childish days, and known
to the full each other's faults, weaknesses, capabilities.
How often you used to lecture me on my selfishness, my
headstrong will, my impulsiveness.  Ah me! how often
that sweet little child face of yours looks back at me
from the mists of the past.  I have only to close my
eyes and I see you, oh, so plainly, in your simple cotton
frock, and with your great eyes upraised to mine.  I
can even feel the touch of your little hand on my arm;
and your voice&mdash;will ever a woman's voice on the face of
God's earth thrill my soul and calm my wild heart as
yours has done, and does?  Oh! the pity of it all; the
pity of it....
</p>

<p>
"My pen is running away with me, my thoughts are
no longer under my control.  As I sit alone here, I hear
a band in the street below playing a sad waltz air, an air
that we danced to once, this season that is over.  How
it brings you back to me.  I can see the colour of the
dress you wore.  I feel the scents of the flowers in your
breast; you are floating by my side and your heart beats
close to mine.  Ah! the music ceases; you are gone?
I am looking out on the evening sky; purple and gold
and amethyst, the clouds bordered with a fringe of fire as
the sun just sinks away.  Perhaps you are looking at the
same sky; perhaps your thoughts&mdash;&mdash;.  But no, I will
not dare to say that.  It is so hard.  Lorry, oh, so hard,
to think that we are not now as we were.  Do you think
I have grown sentimental?  I, who was always so
rough and wild and impetuous, and laughed to scorn the
milk-and-water of poetry?  No.  I think you will
know what it is that is in me, and with me, and why I feel
like this; as the thoughts flow into my mind, my hand
traces them just as in those past happy days.  I can
put into words for you, and you alone, the strange
feelings and wild imaginings that no other human being
ever suspects me of possessing.  This is a long letter.
Perhaps you will smile at it.  I should not wonder;
but, in any case, don't visit its folly on the writer, who is
now and always&mdash;Yours only,
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"KEITH."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
In the reddened glow of the fire-blaze Lauraine reads
these words.  Her eyes grow dark and misty; a strange,
soft trouble takes possession of her heart.
</p>

<p>
"He is quite right," she thinks.  "We two stand to
each other in quite a different light to what we do to any
one else.  It was so natural once to speak to each other
like this; but, though I thought I knew Keith, I am
afraid I did not.  I never gave him credit for such depth
of feeling.  I thought, after that day, he would forget me.
And, after all&mdash;&mdash;"  A heavy sigh breaks from her lips.
</p>

<p>
She folds the letter together, and puts it in her pocket.
Her husband's lies on the table, unopened.
</p>

<p>
"Sir Francis is a good correspondent," remarks Lady
Etwynde.  "Is he enjoying his cruise?"
</p>

<p>
"Sir Francis!" murmurs Lauraine, vaguely.  "I&mdash;I
have not read his letter yet."
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon!" exclaims Lady Etwynde,
hastily, and colouring with embarrassment.  It has not
occurred to her that that long, bold, manly scrawl could
be from any one but Sir Francis.  Lauraine takes up the
other letter now.  No closely covered sheets here.
Rather a different missive:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
"DEAR LAURAINE,
</p>

<p>
"Weather beastly; every one out of sorts.  Awfully
slow, if it wasn't for Lady Jean.  Hope you and the boy
are all right.  Ask some people for next month.  The
Salomans will come back with me.&mdash;Yours,
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"FRANCIS VAVASOUR
</p>

<p>
"PS.&mdash;Will write and say what date to expect us."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Husbands don't trouble to write long letters,"
remarks Lauraine, folding up this curt epistle.  "Sir
Francis is going to bring the Salomans here next month.
I wonder what on earth Lady Jean will do with herself."
</p>

<p>
"She will organize all sorts of entertainments, and turn
the place upside down," answers Lady Etwynde.  "Are
you going to have a large party?"
</p>

<p>
"I suppose so.  I am sorry for it.  I hoped to have a
long spell of rest and quiet."
</p>

<p>
"You will ask your mother, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"My mother?" Lauraine starts and looks uncomfortable.
"I&mdash;I don't know.  I haven't thought about it."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder what is in the background," thinks Lady
Etwynde to herself.  "She and her mother don't get
on; and there is Keith Athelstone.  Did she make
Lauraine marry Sir Francis?  I should have thought the
girl had sufficient strength of mind to hold her own
against persuasion.  Still one never knows."
</p>

<p>
Alone in her dressing-room before dinner Lauraine
reads again that letter of Keith Athelstone's.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder what I ought to do," she thinks.  "Is it
dangerous to go on with this?  The case looks so
different to just 'us two' to what it would, to an
outsider.  And though I might send him away now, we should
be sure to meet again at some period or another.  The
world is never wide enough to part those who <i>ought</i> to
be parted.  And the poor fellow is so unhappy.  No one
understands him as I do.  I know in books whenever
there is anything of this sort, any danger, the two
people always go into heroics, and part nobly, and have
fearful sufferings to endure; but then in the third
volume everything is sure to come right.  If I thought,
if I knew there would be a third volume in <i>our</i> lives...
Ah, dear me, when do things ever come right in real
life?  Never, never, never."  With a weary sigh that
ends these thoughts she locks the letter away.
</p>

<p>
Far enough is she from guessing then what will soon
put it and the writer out of her thoughts.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the Lady Etwynde is seriously disturbed
and perplexed.  She is too genuinely fond of Lauraine
not to perceive that she has some inward trouble weighing
on her mind, and yet she does not ask its nature, or even
appear to notice it.  She knows the girl is pure-minded,
loyal, self-controlled; but so have been other women,
who, beneath a sudden tempting&mdash;a fierce, wild,
incomprehensible passion&mdash;have fallen from their high
estate.  And there is that in and about Lauraine that
betrays that she could love very deeply, very passionately,
with that absorption of herself into what she loves that
is so dangerous a trait in any woman's character.  To
the weak, the placid, the prosaic, the cold, such a nature
as this is quite incomprehensible.  To the untempted
it is so easy to be strong; to the cold, so easy to be
virtuous.  The conquest of self seems so possible when
you have not to count the cost.  To yourself? ah, no,
not to <i>yourself</i>, but to one other who is all the world to
you, and whose pain and sorrow intensify your own till
the agony grows too much for human strength to bear.
</p>

<p>
Lady Etwynde had no personal experience to guide
her through this maze of conclusions; but she had an
immense amount of sympathy, and an infinite tenderness
of nature.  It pleased her to veil and deny this to the
world at large, but it made her all the more beloved by the
chosen few whom she neither could nor would deceive.
</p>

<p>
For Lauraine she had conceived a strong liking, not the
mere pretty, gushing fancy that stands in lieu of
friendship with so many women of the world; but an earnest
and appreciative affection that would serve and stand by
her all her life.  She had a shrewd suspicion that all was
not right with her; some care, some secret trouble, was
preying on her mind, she felt assured.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps, in time, she will tell me," she thinks to
herself.  "I hope she may.  I might help her.  Brooding
over these things with one's self always makes them
worse.  What a woman can't talk of is bad for her.  It
eats into her heart and life, and absorbs all that is best
in both.  There is a disdain, a weariness about Lauraine
unnatural in one so young.  She loves her child, that one
can see; but apart and aside from him she seems to have
no life, no interest.  Apathy, indifference, despair;
those are not things that should be about her yet; but I
know they are.  And why?"
</p>

<p>
The dinner-bell sounds, and puts an end to her reflections,
and she goes down the great oak staircase in her floating,
artistic draperies, and, despite her beauty and her
picturesqueness, actually has the bad taste to murmur
</p>

<p>
"What a comfort there are no men here!"

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV
</h3>

<p>
The storm that threatened at sunset fulfils its prediction
as night draws on.  Lauraine, lying awake in her bed,
hears the howling of the wind, the fierce rush and
sweep of the rain, the far-off roar of angry waves that
dash against the dreary iron-bound cliffs.
</p>

<p>
Once, suddenly, amid the noise of the elements, she
fancies she hears a strange sound from the adjoining
room, the room that she has turned into a night nursery,
that her child may be as near her as possible.  She
sits up and listens; but all is still.
</p>

<p>
Again she lies down, but a restless, troubled feeling
is on her.  Sleep seems impossible.  She rises and puts
on a loose white dressing-robe, and, softly opening the
door of communication, steps into the nursery.
</p>

<p>
A night-light is burning dimly, the fire in the grate
throws a fitful blaze around.  She moves swiftly to the
little lace-curtained cot, and bends over the child.
</p>

<p>
What is it she hears that blanches her face with terror,
that strikes cold and chill to her heart?  Her arms are
round the little figure; a cry arouses the sleeping woman
in her bed beside the little cot.  She springs up and sees
her mistress, and in an instant is by her side.
</p>

<p>
Too well she knows the meaning of that hoarse, strange
sound.  The cold and cruel wind has done its work.
In another moment the household is aroused.  The
stillness of the night is all one tumult of voices and
feet.  Lady Etwynde, startled by the noise, goes
straight to Lauraine's room, and finds it untenanted;
but there in the nursery, with a face white with despair,
a vague, pitiful terror in the eyes that turn from the
little figure in her arms to the pitying faces around, sits
the poor young mother.  The struggles for breath, the
hoarse, horrible cry that once heard is never forgotten,
tell Lady Etwynde their own tale.
</p>

<p>
Some one has taken a horse and gone for a doctor.  The
usual remedies of hot bath and steam have been applied.
They can only wait, wait in that agony of suspense which
is the cruellest suffering of life.  Weeping, frightened,
the little crowd fill the room.  The mother alone is
dry-eyed and calm.  Her voice from time to time wakes the
silence with all the fond and tender words the baby ears
have grown familiar with.  Sometimes a quiver of
agony passes over her face as she sees the terrible
suffering, as the lovely star-like eyes gaze up at her in a
wondering, imploring way, seeming to beseech help and ease
from one who loves him so.
</p>

<p>
The night wears on.  The leaden-footed hours drag
their way wearily towards the dawn.  Slowly the wind
dies away in sobbing sighs; slowly the silver streak of
coming day paints all the black and lowering clouds that
roll stormily aside.  And then at last the doctor comes,
and the little figure is taken from its mother's arms.
Another hour goes on to join the rank of those so
weighted with agony and fear.  And with it goes on suspense;
with it flickers the little life in those cruel spasms
of pain; flickers more and more faintly, watched with
hope that only fades into despair.
</p>

<p>
The dawn breaks, the brightness of the new day
bursts upon a waking world that welcomes it with life.
But the brightness of the golden sun shines upon a baby
face, that leans white and still and painless now upon its
mother's breast, and something that is not the dullness
of the morning strikes to her heart, stilling its throbs,
stifling its agony of dread.
</p>

<p>
Her child is hers no longer!
</p>

<p>
With gentle touch, with pitying words, her friend
strives to draw her from that room.  In vain.
</p>

<p>
She kneels beside the little cot where the tiny
figure lies so still, so calm now; her tearless eyes riveted
on the lovely little face; eyes so wild, so passionate, so
entreating, that none dare meet their gaze.
</p>

<p>
"He is only asleep; he has not&mdash;left me," she cries:
and weeping, they stand aside and know not what to do.
</p>

<p>
Then Lady Etwynde bade them all go out, and knelt
down by Lauraine's side.  The tears dimmed her eyes,
her gentle heart was wrung at the sight of this mute,
blank suffering.  "Dear, do try and realize it," she
whispered tenderly.  "It is hard, terribly hard, I know.
But for him, doubtless it is best."
</p>

<p>
"Best!"  Lauraine rose to her feet, and looked
blankly around.  The bath, the blankets, the paraphernalia
of that brief illness; the sunlight streaming in
through the window; the little figure so still, so strangely
still, all struck on her with a dull, hopeless pain, as
of something missing ... gone out of her life....
</p>

<p>
Then a low moan broke from her lips.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, God! let me die too!"
</p>

<p>
That awful day of pain and grief rolls on.  To Lady
Etwynde it seems the most terrible she has ever known.
Lauraine has passed from one fit of unconsciousness into
another.  They watch and tend her in ever-increasing
fear.  Lady Etwynde has telegraphed to London for a
physician, and also to Mrs. Douglas and Sir Francis,
though she fears the latter will not receive her message
without considerable delay, owing to the uncertainty of
his movements.
</p>

<p>
In the darkened house they all move with hushed
steps; and in one room, where noise and merriment has
been so rife but yesterday, there is <i>something</i> lying white
and still, with flowers piled high upon its snowy covering.
Something from whose angelic beauty all trace of earth
has passed, something in whose presence all grief is
stilled, and tears forget to flow.  Again and again does
Lady Etwynde steal into that room and gaze on the
exquisite face on which death has left no shadow of
dread, no trace of plain.  It seems as if only the mystery
of sleep had sealed the marble lids, and left that strange,
soft, trance-like calm upon the once restless body.
</p>

<p>
The little sinless soul must be happy now, she thinks;
but, oh! the agony that is left, the awful sense of loss,
loneliness, despair, through which that robbed and
paralysed motherhood must wade ... the deep waters
ere comfort is reached ... when every sight and sound
will bring back the memory of loss, when every child's
voice will strike sharp as a knife to the aching heart that
holds the echo of but one.  Alas, alas! for the desolation
of this sad young life, that, clinging but to one joy
amidst all the storms and sorrows and weariness around,
sees it snatched suddenly from its hold, and looks out on
a future blank and desolate as a starless night, where all is
shrouded from sight and touch, and every landmark
obliterated.
</p>

<p>
Another day comes to replace the wretchedness of
this.  Lauraine rises white and calm from her bed, and
still dry-eyed and tearless, takes up life with its new
burden of sorrow.  Arrangements, orders, all devolve
upon her.  No word has come from Sir Francis, but a
telegram announces that her mother will be there that
night.  Lady Etwynde watches her in the deepest
distress.  This cold, strange, tearless grief is worse than
the most frantic sorrow.  It seems to chill all sympathy,
to harden her, as it were, against all offers of consolation.
When Mrs. Douglas arrives it is just the same.  Her
reception of her mother is almost cold, and, pleading
fatigue as an excuse, she retires to her own rooms,
leaving Lady Etwynde to do the entertaining.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Douglas, who dislikes Lady Etwynde, grumbles
openly at her daughter's strange behaviour.
</p>

<p>
"So odd, so cold, so unfeeling, as if I could not
sympathize with her loss&mdash;I, who have lost two children of
my own.  And to shut herself apart from every one like
that, it is positively unnatural."
</p>

<p>
"It has been an awful shock to her," says Lady
Etwynde gravely.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, of course; but then, such a baby; and
she is young, she will have plenty more.  But I never
knew any one so changed as Lauraine is since she married.
She is not a bit like the same girl."
</p>

<p>
"Marriage does change people, you know," answers
Lady Etwynde, looking calmly back at Mrs. Douglas.
"And I never thought Lauraine was happy."
</p>

<p>
"Happy!  What in heaven's name does she want?
She has everything that could satisfy a woman, I am
sure, and it was quite a&mdash;a love-match."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed!" says Lady Etwynde, arching her delicate
eyebrows.  "On whose side?"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Douglas passes by this question loftily.  "She
is of a cold nature, and utterly different to me.  I am sure
if she had had to bear all the troubles and worries I have
put up with during my life she might talk of unhappiness.
Lauraine's unhappiness must be something like a
crumpled rose-leaf, I imagine."
</p>

<p>
Lady Etwynde only looks quietly at her for a moment.
"I don't think you quite understand her," she says.
"There may be natures that cannot find happiness in
position, society, and&mdash;diamonds.  Of course it is very
odd that they should not do so, some sense or faculty
must be wanting; but all the same, they do exist."
</p>

<p>
"I hope she is not going to begin one of her lectures on
culture," thinks Mrs. Douglas in inward perturbation.
Aloud she says: "It is very awkward, Sir Francis not
being here.  And yachting about, like he is doing, perhaps
he won't get the news for ever so long.  Who has made
all the arrangements?"
</p>

<p>
"Lauraine," answers Lady Etwynde.
</p>

<p>
"But how odd, how cold.  Why does she not have
some one&mdash;the clergyman, or the doctor?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't think it is out of a mother's province to act
as Lauraine is doing," answers Lady Etwynde,
composedly.  "My only regret is that she is so calm, so
self-controlled.  If she could only cry!"
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" murmurs Mrs. Douglas, plaintively.  "I
told you she was so cold and hard.  Even as a child she
seldom cried."
</p>

<p>
"Tears are no sign of deep feeling," says Lady
Etwynde, sternly; "far otherwise.  Some of the
shallowest and most selfish people I have known, can cry
for the least thing.  Lauraine's grief is very terrible to
me, because she will not give it natural outlet.  I know
what the child was to her."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Douglas looks at the fire, and is silent.
</p>

<p>
She feels irritated, annoyed with Lauraine.  Annoyed
because she lets people see her unhappiness in the life
chosen for her; annoyed because of her coldness and
indifference towards herself.  They have never had much
in common; but since her marriage, since the suppression
of that letter from Keith Athelstone, Lauraine has
never been the same to her mother.
</p>

<p>
"So ridiculous not to make the best of her position,"
she thinks, impatiently.  "What on earth is the use
of pretending to be a martyr?  Perhaps now that she
has lost the child she will think more of the father."
</p>

<p>
The father!  He is at that moment stretched on a pile
of cushions on the deck of his yacht, the blue, rippling
waters turned to silver in the moonrays, and his eyes
gazing up at the liquid, brimming orbs of the Lady Jean.
</p>

<p>
"Tired&mdash;with you?" he murmurs.  "That could
never be!"
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
And his wife stands broken-hearted by the side of their
little dead child!

CHAPTER XV
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  The body faints sore,<br>
  It is tired in the race.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Do you know Erlsbach?
</p>

<p>
Very likely not.  You won't find it in any map or
guide-book, or directions to fashionable spas and
watering-places.  You won't find it by this name either, for its
people call it differently.  It is just a little dusky spot on
the confines of the Austrian Tyrol, a little village shut in
by pine forests washed by silvery waters; quaint, old
world, unremarkable, but beautiful exceedingly.
</p>

<p>
In the warm June weather Erlsbach is at its best.  So
green, and fragrant, and cool, with soft airs blowing from
the pine forests, and the gleam of snow on the mountain
heights, and the emerald waters of the river shining in
vivid brightness where the sunrays slant amidst the
greenness of the boughs.  It boasts of but one hotel does
Erlsbach, a little old-fashioned hostelry, with nothing to
recommend it save that it is very clean and picturesque,
and its people are honest as the day.
</p>

<p>
To Erlsbach, and, as a matter of course, to the Kaiser
Hof, come one June evening a party of two ladies and
two maids, a courier, and luggage <i>en attendance</i>.  Their
arrival is expected, their rooms are taken; the best
rooms, with a balcony overlooking the river, and that
far-off view of the mountain heights beyond, where the
purple light of evening is melting on the whiteness of
eternal snows.  When the bustle of arrival is over, one
of the two ladies comes out on the balcony and stands
there for long, looking out at the pretty, peaceful scene.
A voice from a room within speaks after a time:
</p>

<p>
"Do you like it, Lauraine?"
</p>

<p>
The figure moves, turns half round.  "It is like a poem,"
she says, softly.  "Like it?  One can hardly say that;
one <i>feels</i> it."  The speaker advances and joins her.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; you are right.  I only came here once; it
was years ago, and my heart was heavy with a great
sorrow.  I left it behind me, Lauraine; buried it amid
the lonely woods and mountain ways.  Oh, my dear,
my dear, if you might do the same?"
</p>

<p>
A sigh parts the beautiful grave lips of Lauraine
Vavasour; she grows very pale.  "That cannot be,"
she says, faintly.  "I could never forget easily; and
this, this was part of my life&mdash;myself.  Do not let us speak
of it, Etwynde; it hurts me still."
</p>

<p>
"People say to talk of their troubles lightens them."
</p>

<p>
"I am not like that then.  My sorrow is shut in my
heart.  I cannot bear to profane it with speech."
</p>

<p>
"But it makes it so much harder to bear, Lauraine."
</p>

<p>
"Not to me; nothing on earth, even your sympathy,
could lighten it."
</p>

<p>
Lady Etwynde is silent.  Her thoughts go back to that
dreary, awful time when the child's death was yet so new
a thing; it is nearly nine months ago now, and Lauraine
has been all that time in the gloomy old mansion on the
Northumbrian shores.  The funeral had been long over
before Sir Francis returned, and then he had made but
a brief stay, and gone to Scotland with some friends.
</p>

<p>
"Fretting could do no good," he said philosophically,
and he hated the gloomy quietude of Falcon's Chase, and
was only too glad to leave it.  Lady Etwynde stayed
with Lauraine all through that dreary winter; she could
not bear to leave her alone in her grief and despair, for
the sorrow seemed but to take deeper root in her nature.
Even all Lady Etwynde's gentle sympathy could make no
way.  She half-feared and only half-comprehended this
new phase in her friend's character.  For she could not
know that Lauraine felt a terror of herself now; that it
seemed to her as if the one safeguard she had clung to
had been swept from her hold, and she lay anchorless,
shelterless on the great dark sea of life, beholding no
hope or ray of light, turn where she would.
</p>

<p>
The chill of winter passed into the fair, sweet month
of spring; but no change came to her.  Nothing seemed
to thaw the ice about her heart.  A strange chill and
silence from the outer world rested upon her life as it was
now.  Of all her many friends and acquaintances none
seemed to remember her or heed her.  Keith
had written again and yet again; she had never answered
him once.  She <i>dared</i> not.  His sympathy, his presence
would have been a comfort too great not to be dangerous,
and the more she longed for them the more rigorously she
denied them to herself.  With the spring her husband
wrote to know whether she wanted to come to town for
the season.  She read the letter with a shuddering
horror.  The season!  To dance, drive, gossip, kill time
in a round of empty pleasures; sate herself with luxury
and extravagance.  The thought seemed loathsome to
her now.  Her youth and all that was best in her seemed
to have died with her little child.  Her eyes seemed ever to
have that look in them that has so frightened and pained
her friend; the look as of tears that could not fall.
</p>

<p>
She was awfully, terribly changed, both in body and
mind, and when Lady Etwynde paid her a flying visit,
tearing herself from æsthetic joys and the glories of the
Grosvenor Gallery Exhibition, and endless <i>réunions</i>
among the cultured, she was shocked and alarmed at the
alteration.
</p>

<p>
"You must leave here, or you will go melancholy
mad!" she said, imperatively; and Lauraine, having
arrived at that stage when she was too spiritless and too
indifferent to oppose any vigorous scheme, yielded
passively, and was borne off to Erlsbach.
</p>

<p>
Sir Francis, of course, could not come.  He liked
London, and was not going to give up its thousand and
one enjoyments for the sake of an invalid's whim.  Her
mother offered voluntarily to sacrifice herself in the
matter; but Lauraine would not hear of it, and in the
end she and Lady Etwynde, under charge of an
experienced courier, set out for Germany and, travelling by
slow and easy stages, arrived one warm June evening at
quaint, pretty Erlsbach.
</p>

<p>
"But, Lauraine," says Lady Etwynde, continuing the
conversation after a long, thoughtful pause, "have you
ever considered that it is like putting yourself in rebellion
against God to go on like this?  All strokes of sorrow are
sent for some wise purpose.  We do not see it, believe it,
at the time; but, later on&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ah," interrupts Lauraine, "that is just it.  It has
not come to 'later on' with me.  I had but one thing
to make me happy; it has gone.  Don't expect me to be
consoled in a few months."
</p>

<p>
"But, my dear, you have your husband, your duties.
Do you know it seems to me as if you were, in a way,
estranging yourself from him?"
</p>

<p>
"He can find plenty of amusement in the world,"
says Lauraine, coldly.  "Little Frank was nothing to
him, except just simply the heir who would come after
him in due time, and keep the estates in the family.  But
to me&mdash;&mdash;"  She breaks off abruptly.
</p>

<p>
The faint wind from the pine woods blows over her
head and ruffles the soft dusky curls above her brow.
In that dim light, with her pale, beautiful face turned
upwards to the purple sky, she looks so young, so fair, so
sorrowful, that a rush of tears dims Lady Etwynde's
eyes as she gazes at her.  "I didn't think she would
have taken her sorrow to heart like this.  How little
one knows, after all!" she thinks to herself.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
A week drifts by.  Amidst that tranquil pastoral loveliness,
amidst the beauty of the woods and streams, in
the whole dreamy, simple life they lead, Lauraine rests and
rejoices in such quiet, unecstatic fashion as is left to her.
Her sorrow seems less hard and cold a thing here; the
angel face of her lost darling comes with a more tender
grace to her memory.  She can talk and even smile with
something of the old playful witchery that used to be hers.
There is always something new to see; there are no landmarks
here as at Falcon's Chase to recall the footsteps of
that baby life whose journeying was so short a one.  She
begins to feel a little interest in places and things once
more.  She likes Lady Etwynde's talk, even when it may
be on culture and ethics; she can listen to her when she
reads out, which she does admirably as well as judiciously.
On the whole, there is a decided improvement about the
mental "tone" that delights Lady Etwynde, though
she never appears to notice it.
</p>

<p>
Life and worldly cares, and even worldly joys, seemed
sometimes to sink into almost insignificance amidst these
mountain solitudes.  They were so grand, so sublime, so
immovable.  Their lessons came home to Lauraine's
aching heart, and soothed and comforted it insensibly to
herself.  She grew less sad, she brooded less over what
she had lost.  She had no hope, nothing to look forward
to; yet still the present so steeped her in peace and rest
that it seemed to her in after years as if these fragrant
forests, this wilderness of ferns and flowers, these foaming
waters, and far-off gleam of shining glaciers and crowning
snows, had possessed some magic power that insensibly
soothed and lulled her heart's long pain.
</p>

<p>
Late one afternoon she and Lady Etwynde are returning
from a drive to a little village some two miles distant.
The sun is just setting above the forest heights, there is
alternate light and gloom among the heavy foliage, those
beautiful shades of green and gold that make up so
much of the charm of a wood.  Lady Etwynde is driving
rather quickly, and the road is narrow.  Before them she
sees the figure of a horseman proceeding leisurely along.
At the near approach of the ponies' rapid trot he draws
his horse aside to make room.  Lauraine leaning back in
the little low carriage, gives a careless glance up as she
passes, then all the pallor of her face flushes deepest
scarlet; she starts forward with an exclamation of
amazement.  Lady Etwynde notices it, and reins in the
ponies.  "Mr. Athelstone!  Is it possible?" she says.
</p>

<p>
In astonishment quite as genuine, Keith draws the
bridle, and bends towards the two figures.
</p>

<p>
"What a strange meeting," he says, as he shakes
hands first with Lauraine, then with Lady Etwynde.
</p>

<p>
"I thought you were in London," Lauraine says
quickly.  After one wild leap of joy her heart seems to
grow still and cold with a great dread.  What evil fate,
she wonders, has thrown him across her path now?
</p>

<p>
They are all too genuinely astonished to be embarrassed,
and Keith proceeds to explain how he has been mountaineering
for the last month in the Tyrol district; how his
headquarters at present are that very little village they
have just visited; and how he has ridden over to
Erlsbach from idle curiosity, to see what the place is like.
Of course there remains nothing for it but to invite him
to the Kaiser Hof, and an hour later the trio are sitting
at dinner, the table drawn close by the open window,
and the fresh pine-scented air blowing in cool and soft
from the mountains.  Keith and Lauraine talk very
little to each other.  The brunt of the conversation falls
on Lady Etwynde, and she in no way objects.  Keith
has always been a favourite of hers, and they have many
sharp and witty arguments, while that pale, grave figure
in the soft draperies listens and smiles, and feels at once
disturbed and restless, and yet glad.
</p>

<p>
Sooner or later they would meet.  She had known
that always, but had never dreamt of it being so soon, or
so strangely.
</p>

<p>
Somehow in life the meetings we expect never do take
place as we expect them.  We may rehearse our little
scenes as carefully as we please, we may arrange our looks,
our words, the very tones of our voices, but when the
actual <i>rencontre</i> does occur it is sure to be utterly different,
and the carefully-arranged programme is never carried out.
</p>

<p>
It is so with Lauraine now.  She has sometimes
longed, sometimes dreaded to meet him, but always
imagined it at some distant time and in some totally
different manner; and now Keith is sitting at her table,
her own guest, smiling, talking, looking at her to all
appearance as unconcerned and forgetful as if that
"garden scene" had never been enacted.
</p>

<p>
He is a better actor than herself, and he determines
to be it.  She shows that she is troubled, pained,
perplexed.  He ignores everything that might lead to that
past, is careless, cynical, indifferent as of yore; but all
the time his heart is beating with tumultuous pain;
he is thinking how sadly altered she is, how changed from
the bright, beautiful Lauraine of his boyhood, and yet
dearer to him in her sufferings and sorrow than in any
years that are past.  It is hard work to keep down the
thoughts that are thronging, the love that is leaping, the
joy that is thrilling his every sense; but he knows it must
be done, and he succeeds in doing it and in deceiving
Lauraine.  The cloth is removed.  The soft dusk settles
on the pretty quiet scene without.  Lady Etwynde, who
dislikes a glare of light, blows out nearly all the
illumination of candles in the room, and they sit there by the
window watching the stars come out one by one, talking
less now, but with something grave and earnest in the
talk that it has lacked before.
</p>

<p>
At last Lady Etwynde rises, and, saying she has
letters to write, moves away to a little inner room,
partitioned off by curtains from the one where they
have all been sitting.  It is solitude, yet not solitude.  The
sense of being together, the knowledge that their low
tones are unheard, is just restrained by the feeling that
another person is close at hand.  Keith is silent for
some moments, then bends towards Lauraine.
</p>

<p>
"You never answered my letters; I could hardly expect
it.  But I do hope you believe I felt for your grief?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she answers, simply; "I always felt sure of that."
</p>

<p>
"I am glad you say so.  When you never wrote I
thought you were offended, indifferent, perhaps.  It has
been a terribly blank time for me."
</p>

<p>
"I think you have no right to tell me that," she says,
flushing and paling with nervous agitation.  "I cannot
help you, and it only adds to the sufferings of my own
life that yours is also sad."
</p>

<p>
"Sad!" he echoes, wearily.  "If you only knew
<i>how</i> sad.  But you are right; I ought not to speak of that.
How strange it seems to meet you here; almost makes
one believe in Fate!  To think that I rose this morning
and rode off haphazard, not even guessing you were
within a hundred miles of me, and now, at evening, I am
sitting by your side!"
</p>

<p>
"How is it you have forsaken the London season?"
</p>

<p>
"It I told you the <i>real</i> truth you would be angry, and
I cannot utter conventional lies to you, Lorry."
</p>

<p>
She trembles a little.  Her eyes go out to the shining
river that mirrors the silver glory of the starlight.  At
her heart a dull pain beats.  "Your friends, the Americans,
where are they?" she asks evasively.
</p>

<p>
"In Paris, I believe.  At least, they may have left
now; but they were there up to May.  Nan is mad about
Paris."  "Nan," be it remarked, is what he always calls
Miss Anastasia Jefferson.  Lauraine knows this, and
smiles a little.
</p>

<p>
"You and she are as great friends as ever, I suppose?"
she remarks.
</p>

<p>
"She is a jolly little girl," Keith answers, carelessly.
"Yes, I suppose we are friends in a way.  We are always
quarrelling, and yet always making it up."
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you&mdash;marry&mdash;her?" asks Lauraine.
</p>

<p>
He stares at her as if uncertain of what he has heard.
"Marry Nan!  Good Lord!  I never dreamt of such a
thing!"
</p>

<p>
"Other people have," continues Lauraine; "even the
girl herself, I fancy."
</p>

<p>
He laughs a little bitterly.  "What fad have you got
into your head?  Nan looks upon me as a sort of elder
brother.  There has never been anything of 'that sort'
between us.  As for marrying, well, <i>you</i> ought to know
I am not likely to do that."
</p>

<p>
"I think you ought to marry," says Lauraine, very
quietly.  "You see you have wealth and position, and
yet you lead such a 'homeless' kind of life.  That is the
only word that expresses it.  And some day surely you will
think of settling down; you cannot be always like this."
</p>

<p>
"<i>You</i> counsel me to marry," he says, with bitterness.
"Have you found the experience so pleasant a one?"
</p>

<p>
The crimson colour rushes all over the proud fair face.
"That has nothing to do with it," she says, coldly.
</p>

<p>
"Has it not?  Well, if I choose to be faithful to a
memory, that is my look out.  I am not one to forget
easily, as I have told you before."
</p>

<p>
"And you don't care for Miss Jefferson?" asks
Lauraine, unwisely.
</p>

<p>
He looks at her in silence for a moment, and under
the strong magnetism of his glance, her eyes turn from the
scene without and meet his own.
</p>

<p>
"I think <i>you</i> should know," he says, very softly.
</p>

<p>
There comes the sound of a rustling skirt, a closing
door.  Lady Etwynde has left the inner room; they are
alone.  In an instant he is kneeling by the low chair on
which she sits.  Her hands are clasped in his.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Lorry, Lorry!" he cries; "it is so hard!"
</p>

<p>
The passionate plaint thrills to her very heart.  She
lays her hands on either shoulder, and looks down into
the pain-filled depths of the blue eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I know it, dear," she says, very gently.  "Is it not
hard for me too?"
</p>

<p>
"You are so cold, so different, and then you have your
home, your husband, your&mdash;&mdash;.  Oh, forgive me, darling!
How could I be so thoughtless?"
</p>

<p>
He sees the spasm of pain on the white face, the sudden
quiver of the soft red lips.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I have nothing now!" she groans, despairingly,
and her two hands go up to hide her face.  A storm of
passionate weeping shakes her from head to foot.  Keith
is alarmed, distressed, but he is wise enough to rise and
stand quietly by.  He attempts no consolation.
</p>

<p>
The storm abates at last.  Those tears have done
Lauraine good.  She has been cold and hard in her grief
for so long a time.  She also rises, a little ashamed,
a little confused.  "Let us go out on the balcony,"
she says, and he follows her without a word.
</p>

<p>
It seems like a dream to him; a dream that will never
be forgotten, that will haunt his memory with a vivid
thrill of pain whenever he feels the scents of mountain
air, or sees the gleam of quiet stars.  With them, too, he
will see the little balcony of the quaint old "Hof," and a
slender figure with draperies of dusky black, and a face
white, solemn, inexpressibly sad that looks back to his.
</p>

<p>
"Keith," she says, very gently, "there has come a time
when I must be frank with you.  You say you do not
forget, that you cannot.  In that case, if you have any
honour at all, you must see that you should avoid me.
Of myself, of my pain, I will not speak.  What use?
Between us two lies a barrier we can never cross.  When
you say such words to me as you have said to-night, you
make the very question of friendship an impossibility.
Is there any thought in our minds that in any way is
cold enough for <i>that</i>.  I doubt it.  Mind, I say 'ours.'  I
make no pretence at deceiving you."
</p>

<p>
"You do not deny that you love me?"
</p>

<p>
"Of what use?" she says.  "I made a fatal error in
my marriage.  But error or not, I must keep to it and
its consequences.  Only, Keith, if you had any pity,
and mercy, you would avoid me, leave me to fight out
my life alone.  At least I owe my husband&mdash;fidelity."
</p>

<p>
A hundred words rush to his lips.  It is in his mind
then to tell her of what her husband really is; of the
scandals that are whispered in club and boudoir, over
cigarettes and Souchong, but something restrains him.
It would be mean, he thinks; and, after all, would it
make any difference to her?  Had she been any other
woman....  And, after all, she loves <i>him</i>, not her husband.
On that small crumb of comfort he feeds his starved and
aching heart, standing there beside her, silent, troubled,
fighting against every wild and passionate impulse that
bids him fling honour and scruples to the wind, and
snatch at the perilous joy of a sinful happiness.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she says, with a heavy sigh.  "I must at least
give that.  The best part of me and my life is laid in the
grave of my little child.  Often I think I shall never
feel glad again, but after to-night I leave it to you
whether you are to make my life harder for me, or help
me to struggle against myself."
</p>

<p>
His eyes gleam with momentary anger, petulance,
pride.  "You give me a hard enough task, I hope,"
he says passionately.  "And yet your last words hold
all the tempting that could possibly beset a man.  Why
should I save you from yourself?  By heaven if you
loved me, if you only knew <i>how</i> I love you, you would
not count the cost of anything that stood between us and
our happiness!"
</p>

<p>
"Would it be happiness?" answers Lauraine.  "I
think <i>not</i>, Keith.  Is a guilty love ever happy?  Does it
ever last?  If it did the world would not teem with
forsaken women, nor the rivers of our great cities bear
such burdens of shame and despair."
</p>

<p>
"You do not know me, if you doubt.  Have I not been
true to you, since, boy and girl, we stood together, and
played at sweethearts in the old Grange garden at
Silverthorne?  Till I die I shall remember you, and love
you, Lorry."
</p>

<p>
"Other men have said the same, and have forgotten."
</p>

<p>
"Other men!  Yes; but you surely know me well
enough to believe me."
</p>

<p>
"It is because I believe you that I wish to save you
deeper pain.  You cannot command your feelings, and I&mdash;I
must not listen to you now.  It is wrong, shameful."
</p>

<p>
He moves impatiently.  "Your words are very
cruel.  But to me you have always been that.  You
could not be true to me even for a few years."
</p>

<p>
She shudders as if a blow had struck her.  "It is
ungenerous to speak of that now; you know the fault was
not all mine."
</p>

<p>
But Keith is in no mood to listen to her.  His blood
is on fire, his heart is hot and angry, and he feels that
sort of rage within him that longs to spend itself in bitter
words and unjust reproaches, even to one he loves as
dearly as he loves Lauraine.  There is a sort of savage
satisfaction in making her suffer too, and he pours out
a fury of wrath and reproach as she stands there mute
and pale and still.
</p>

<p>
"I am not ice, like yourself," he says, in conclusion,
"Other women love, and forget all else for love.
You&mdash;you are too cold and prudent.  I am young, and you
have wrecked my whole life, and given me nothing but
misery.  I wish I had died a thousand deaths before I
had seen you!"
</p>

<p>
A shiver as of intense cold passes over her.  She knows
Keith's wild temper of old, but she had not thought
it was in him to speak as he had spoken to her.  She
forgets that a great love borders almost on hate, so
intense may be its passions, its longing, its despair.
</p>

<p>
"After all," says Keith, with a mocking laugh
that grates terribly on her ear, "why <i>should</i> I not follow
your advice as well as your example?  Why should I
eat my heart out, and waste my life on an empty love?
You have told me to leave you; that you wish to see me
no more.  Very well; <i>this</i> time I will take you at your
word.  I will leave you, and let the future prove who
was right or wisest.  I&mdash;I will go away!  I <i>will</i> forget!"
</p>

<p>
"It is well," she says, her voice low and faint.  "I
deserve all you have said, and more.  I have only
brought sorrow to you!  Go away, live your own life,
forget me, and be happy again."
</p>

<p>
"Those are your last words?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  My life is hard and sad enough; you would
add to it shame and misery and undying remorse, and
call that a proof of&mdash;love.  Forgive me if I cannot see it
in the same light as yourself."
</p>

<p>
"And I say you do not love me, and never did, or you
would know&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Very well," she interrupts, "believe that.  It is best
that you should."
</p>

<p>
"And I am to go now?" he says, sorrowful and
hesitating.  "If you send me from you to-night,
Lauraine, I will never come back.  Remember that."
</p>

<p>
Both of them are hurt and angry now, both beset
with cruel pain, and waging that terrible conflict with
passionate love and wounded pride that is at once so
ill-judged, and resentful a thing.
</p>

<p>
Lauraine looks steadily away from the entreating,
watchful eyes; away, away to the far-off mountain
range swept with faint grey clouds, silvered by the
clear moonlight and the haze of the shining stars.
</p>

<p>
"If he only knew," she thinks, in the depths of her
aching heart, "if he only, only knew!"
</p>

<p>
But he does not know.  To him she is only cold,
calculating, unloving.  Right and pure he knows in her
mode of loving and thinking; but what man who loves as
Keith loves can see right and purity as they are?
</p>

<p>
"I have never asked you to come back," says Lauraine,
faint and low, "and be very sure I never will.  I am
sorry that you are angry with me.  Perhaps to-morrow
you will be sorry too.  But I know it is best."
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye then!"
</p>

<p>
She turns, and gives him her hand.  He looks at her
long, and the blue eyes grow misty, the fire and anger die
out.  He bends suddenly forward and touches her
fingers with his lips.  He does not speak another word,
only drops her hand and goes.
</p>

<p>
The echo of his footsteps dies away.  The door closes
with a heavy sound.  With a stifled sob Lauraine falls
on her knees, and leans her head against the low
railings of the flower-covered balcony.
</p>

<p>
"Dear Heaven! how hard it is to do right!" she moans.
</p>

<p>
The wind stirs the pine boughs, and the stars shine
calmly down.  They have seen so much of trouble, have
heard so much despair, and to them a human life is such a
little space to sorrow in, or be glad.

CHAPTER XVI
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Cry, O lover,<br>
  Love is over.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
When Lady Etwynde comes back, she finds Lauraine
lying cold and insensible on the little balcony.
</p>

<p>
In great alarm she tries to recover her to consciousness,
and at last succeeds.  With a heavy sigh the dark eyes
open, and Lauraine rises and goes back to her low
lounge by the window, and there lies faint, white, and
exhausted, while, with a great and tender pity, her
friend hovers about, speaking soothing words, and asking
nothing of the cause of this strange fainting fit.  She can
guess it well enough.  Half an hour passes.  Then
Lauraine lifts her head with a little languid smile.
</p>

<p>
"You must think me very foolish," she says.
</p>

<p>
"Why should I?" asks Lady Etwynde, simply.  "My
dear, I think I know what is troubling you.  I have
known it long.  Do not speak of it unless you wish, if it
pains you in any way.  But be sure of my sympathy
always."
</p>

<p>
"I am sure of it," answers Lauraine.  "I think I have
never made a friend of any woman but you.  You are
always so good, and one always feels one can trust you.
But you are right.  Something <i>is</i> troubling me very
much.  I feel to-night as if life was altogether too hard!"
</p>

<p>
"Who of us does not feel <i>that</i> at some time or other?"
says Lady Etwynde, sadly.  "A time when to look back
or to look forward seems alike equally hard; for during
the one we think of what 'might have been,' and during
the other we dread to think what <i>may</i> be.  There are two
very sad things in this life: the waste of love, the dearth
of happiness.  Both of these are with you now.  They
were with me once.  But I lived through the struggle,
and you will do the same.  You think it is impossible
now.  Ah, my dear, so did I; so does every one who
suffers.  And yet physical force drags us on whether we
will or not."
</p>

<p>
"I have been very foolish," says Lauraine, the tears
standing in her eyes as they look out at the quiet night.
"When I was young, a mere girl, Keith and I betrothed
ourselves.  You know my mother was his guardian, and
all our childhood was passed together.  No one could
influence him or manage him as I could.  He was always
impulsive, reckless, passionate, but oh! so loving and
so generous of heart.  Well, as we grew older the love
seemed to grow with us.  Then my mother began to
notice it.  She became alarmed; we were parted; but
still neither of us forgot.  At last Keith spoke to my
mother.  Of course she laughed, and treated it as a boy's
fancy.  He had nothing, and we were not rich; at least,
so she said always.  He grew angry, and said he would
go abroad, and make a fortune.  She said 'very well;
when he had made it he could come back and claim me.'  In
the end he went to America.  We were not allowed to
correspond, and year after year went by.  I heard
nothing from him or about him.  Then I was introduced to
London life.  I had a season of triumphs, gaiety,
amusements.  I will not say it weakened my memory
of Keith, but at least it filled up the emptiness of my life,
and I was young, and enjoyment seemed easy enough.
In my third season, I met Sir Francis Vavasour.  From
that time my mother's whole soul was bent on a marriage
between us.  I cannot tell you now the thousand and
one things that combined to throw us together, to wind
a web about my careless feet.  The memory of Keith had
grown less distinct.  Four years had passed, and no sign.
I began to think he had forgotten.  Later on, I found
my mother had deceived me.  He <i>had</i> written to her,
speaking always of his unfalterable fidelity; then came
the news of brighter prospects of a great fortune in store;
of entreaty to tell me, and let me hear from him.  She did
nothing of the sort.  She only told me that if I did not
accept Sir Francis it meant ruin to her.  That her debts
were enormous; that I had cost her a small fortune in
these three seasons; that&mdash;oh, I cannot tell you it all
now.  I am not naturally weak-minded, but I suffered
myself to be persuaded.  I never attempt to hold myself
blameless; still, had I known about Keith....  Well, on
my wedding-day, I received a letter from him.  He was
possessor of a large fortune, he loved me more than
ever, and he would be in London, at our house, on that
very day.  Imagine my feelings.  It was all too late then.
Nothing could be done.  I had to school myself as best I
could to meet my girlhood's lover an hour after I had
become Sir Francis Vavasour's wife.  It was a terrible
ordeal.  Poor Keith!  Oh, what I felt when I saw what
I had given him to bear.  He was half mad, and I&mdash;oh,
how sick and ashamed and wicked I felt.  We parted
again, and for eighteen months we did not meet.  Then
he came to Rome one winter, and I was there.  He
greeted me like any other acquaintance.  I thought he
had forgotten.  Gradually our old friendship was
resumed.  Gradually he became my constant companion,
and the confidence and sympathy and interests
of the past seemed to awaken, and be with us both
again.  I dreamt of no harm.  He never by word or look
betrayed that he loved me still.  I thought it was all
over and done with, and feared no danger.  I was not
unhappy.  Sir Francis was very kind, and I had my boy.
I troubled myself in no way about what might be said,
Keith had been a sort of brother to me so long.  We
left Rome and came to London.  Then it was that he
betrayed himself; then it was that I too learnt I cared
for him as I had no right to do."
</p>

<p>
"And the Gloire de Dijon roses were left under the
cedar tree," murmurs Lady Etwynde, faintly.
</p>

<p>
Lauraine starts and blushes.  "Yes, it was that night.
I almost hate to think of it, and yet&mdash;oh, Etwynde, <i>can</i>
I help loving him?  <i>Can</i> I tear him out of my heart?"
</p>

<p>
"My dear," says her friend, gravely, "if love were
within our power to give, or to withhold, life would be an
easy enough matter for most of us.  It has been at cross
purposes always.  I suppose it won't change tactics, even
for our advanced age."
</p>

<p>
"Well," sighs Lauraine, wearily, "I did what I could,
but Keith made me promise that I would not banish him;
that I would let him see me sometimes still; that&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"My dear," murmurs Lady Etwynde, gently, "you
were never so foolish as that?"
</p>

<p>
"I was," answers Lauraine.  "I&mdash;I pitied him so,
and he seemed so desperate, and I had done him all the
wrong.  I am not a bit of a heroine, Etwynde.  I have
little moral strength, and he promised he would speak of
love no more, so&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"So you believed him?" interpolates Lady Etwynde.
"Of course, man like, he&mdash;kept his promise?"
</p>

<p>
"Until&mdash;to-night," falters Lauraine.  "When I saw
him, when we met as we did, I cannot tell you how awful
I felt.  It was as if Fate had purposely thrown him across
my path when I was most weak, and most unhappy."
</p>

<p>
"And what have you done?" asks Lady Etwynde, pityingly.
</p>

<p>
"I have sent him away&mdash;for ever!"
</p>

<p>
"Lauraine, had you strength&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Oh," says Lauraine, with a little hysterical laugh,
"we quarrelled desperately first.  He said some dreadful
things to me, and I&mdash;I don't know if I was not equally
hard and unjust.  But in any case it was better than
sentiment&mdash;was it not?  The next thing we shall hear is
that he is going to marry Miss Anastasia Jane Jefferson."
</p>

<p>
"Lauraine, you are jesting!" exclaims Lady Etwynde.
"What, that little American doll who 'guesses' and
'calculates,' and is only a few degrees better than
Mrs. Bradshaw Woollffe?  Impossible!  I know she has a
<i>penchant</i> for him&mdash;at least, it looked like it&mdash;but after
loving you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it will be 'moonlight after sunlight,'" says
Lauraine, bitterly, "if I may copy Tennyson and say so.
Why should he make a martyr of himself?  I can be
nothing to him, and it is all shame, and sin, and horror
now.  Oh, God! that I should live to say so&mdash;my darling
boy&mdash;&mdash;"  A sob breaks from her.  She thinks of Keith&mdash;bold,
bright, <i>debonnaire</i> Keith, with his sunny smile and
his bold, bright eyes that for her were always so soft
and loving; Keith, with his merry ways and wild freaks,
and steadfast, tender heart; Keith as he <i>was</i>, as he never
again can be to her, in all the years to come!
</p>

<p>
"It is all my fault&mdash;mine!" she cries between her
heavy sobs.  "And I have made him so unhappy; and
if he goes to the bad, if he gets wild and reckless, oh,
what shall I do?  How can I sit and bear my life, and
look on <i>his</i>, as if it were nothing to me?"
</p>

<p>
Lady Etwynde kneels beside her and puts her arms
round her in silence.  "It will be hard, terribly hard,"
she says, tenderly.  "But oh, my dear, you have had
strength to do what was right to-day.  You will have
strength to bear the consequences."
</p>

<p>
"Was it right?" wails Lauraine, in exceeding bitterness.
"He said not.  He called me cold and calculating,
and said I have spoilt all his life now, and he is so young,
and I&mdash;&mdash;  Oh, how I could love him now!"
</p>

<p>
"Hush!" whispers Lady Etwynde, gently; "you
must not think of that.  Right!  Of course it was right,
Men are so selfish, that unless a woman ruins herself for
their sake they will always say she does not love.  <i>Love!</i>
Faugh, the word as they mean it is different to our
interpretation.  I have not patience to think of it.  Love
is something purer, holier, nobler than sensual gratification.
It is sympathy, it is fidelity without reward; it
is consecration without a vow.  Did we take our teaching
of it from <i>them</i>, Heaven help us all.  Thank God, something
within us helps us to the right, the pure, the better
part of it.  Lauraine, do not waste your pity thus.
What right had he to dishonour you in your grief, your
loneliness, by any such words as these?  If indeed he
loved you, you should have been sacred to him for your
child's sake, even though he ignored your husband.  Can
you not see it too, dear?  As for saying you have ruined
his life, that is cowardly.  He does not love you
worthily or he would never have uttered so weak a
reproach."  She ceases.  She feels the shudder that
runs through the slender figure.  She knows her words
hurt and sting, but she is pained and angered and sore
distressed.  She feels a hatred and intolerance of Keith
Athelstone's selfish passion.
</p>

<p>
"You do not know," murmurs Lauraine; "you cannot
judge.  Of love no one can, save just the two who
love.  For them it is all so different, and everything else
looks of such small account."
</p>

<p>
A warm flush comes over her face; she dashes the
tears away from her eyes.  Lady Etwynde unloosens the
clasp of her arms, and stands up, a little stern, a little
troubled.
</p>

<p>
"You are right.  An outsider must always take a
calmer and more dispassionate view of the matter; but I
hope in time you will see him as he is.  Once you were
married, your lives lay apart.  He should not have come
near you, and, from your own account, he has broken
all laws of honour, and put the selfishness of passion
before everything that is good and honest and pure."
</p>

<p>
"You are hard on him," says Lauraine, quietly.
"You don't know him as I do.  No one ever did seem
to understand Keith but myself."
</p>

<p>
"He is certainly no paragon of virtue," Lady Etwynde
answers, contemptuously.  "But, my darling, don't let
us quarrel over him.  He is a man, and I know what men
are when they love.  As for you, you have behaved
nobly, despite your pain.  Believe me, the thought will
bring its own comfort in time, and&mdash;you say&mdash;he will
never come back again?"
</p>

<p>
"So he said."
</p>

<p>
"Has he never said that before?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," answers Lauraine; "on my wedding-day."
</p>

<p>
"I hope he will keep his word this time then," says
Lady Etwynde.  "He can do you no good, and he only
makes your life more unhappy.  My dear, be wise for
the future, and avoid him."
</p>

<p>
"That is my only wish now," answers Lauraine, rising
from her low chair and passing her hand wearily across
her aching brow.  "And my only safety, too," she adds,
in her own heart.
</p>

<p>
But Lady Etwynde hears only the first sentence, and is
glad of it and content.
</p>

<p>
"He will not be faithful," she thinks, as she moves by
Lauraine's side to her chamber on the next floor.  "Men
never are.  So much life has taught me!"

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII
</h3>

<p>
"After a storm comes a calm."&mdash;It seemed as if a calm,
the calm of a great despair had settled on Lauraine.  All
human love had passed out of her life; and that life
itself looked grey, colourless as an autumn sky that has
known no sunshine.  But there was something in this
dull stupor that kept the sharpness of pain in abeyance,
that left her, to outward seeming, much the same as ever,
and rejoiced Lady Etwynde's heart.
</p>

<p>
"After all," she thinks to herself, "she could not have
loved him so very much."
</p>

<p>
She does not attempt to allude to the confidence of
that night, nor does Lauraine return to it.  Just for two
or three days she watches with anxious eyes the arrival
of the post: she is half fearful of a letter from Keith, a
letter that will be a sort of blaze of anger, and upbraiding,
like his own last words.  But there comes neither letter
nor sign.
</p>

<p>
After a week or two Lauraine begins to get restless.
</p>

<p>
"This is a place to sleep and dream in," she says to
her friend; "I want to see some life again.  Let us go
to Baden or Monaco."
</p>

<p>
Lady Etwynde is amazed.
</p>

<p>
"Will Sir Francis object?" she asks.
</p>

<p>
Lauraine smiles with faint contempt.  "He never
troubles himself about what I do," she says.  "We will
go, and if he objects, we can leave again!"
</p>

<p>
Lady Etwynde yields, and they go to Baden.
</p>

<p>
Lauraine seems now to have as great a horror of solitude
as before she has had of gaiety.  She is always out,
always restless.  No one they know of the fashionable
world is at Baden, it being yet too early in the season.
It is crowded with Germans and Austrians, and adventurers
of all nationalities, who throng the pretty Kursaal
under the shadow of the pine-crowned hills.
</p>

<p>
Lauraine makes numerous acquaintances, and is
always inventing projects of amusements, such as picnics,
excursions, <i>jêtes</i>, drives, and balls.  She goes to concerts
and theatres, she is one of the loungers in the shady alleys
of the Lichtenthal; she goes to supper-parties that to
Lady Etwynde seem reckless and <i>risqué</i>, and meets all
her friend's feeble remonstrances with the unanswerable
argument that her husband does not mind, and therefore
no one else need trouble their head about it.
</p>

<p>
She seems so horribly, unaccountably changed that it
fills Lady Etwynde's mind with dread and pain.
</p>

<p>
Better the morbid grief, the dreary apathy of the past,
than this feverish and unnatural gaiety, this craving for
excitement and pleasure.  Just as suddenly as she has
gone to Baden, so suddenly does she tire of it.  "She
will go down the Rhine," she declares, "and stop
anywhere that is pretty and picturesque."  The change of
programme delights her friend, and they leave their circle
of new acquaintances desolate at their sudden departure.
</p>

<p>
The lovely scenery and the constant change seem for a
while to quiet Lauraine's restlessness.  She takes a
fancy to Bingen, and stays there for a month; but it
distresses Lady Etwynde to see how pale and thin she
is getting, how weary and sleepless her eyes always look.
</p>

<p>
A letter comes one day from Sir Francis.  He is coming
to Baden for the races; he is going to run a horse for the
Prix de Dames.  They had better remain abroad and
meet him there.  He will arrange for rooms at the
Bairischer Hof, or D'Angleterre, as a lot of people are
coming at the same time.  Meanwhile he hopes Lauraine
is tired of moping, and intends to be reasonable again.
</p>

<p>
She reads the letter quietly through, and then hands
it to Lady Etwynde.
</p>

<p>
"I can scarcely expect you to continue giving up your
time to me as you have done," she says.  "But this
arrangement suits me very well.  It is quiet and pleasant
here, and I shall remain on till the time fixed for Baden.
But you&mdash;there is your home, your own friends&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Unless you are tired of me," interrupts Lady Etwynde,
"I am not going to run away.  I do not think you are
either in health or spirits to be left alone."
</p>

<p>
They are at the Victoria Hof.  Their rooms are very
pleasant; their life has been more like what it was at
Erlsbach, spent chiefly in the open air, in drives and
rambles and excursions on the river, and visits to the
beautiful old Rochus Capelle, which, for Lauraine, has
endless interest, and of which she never seems to tire.
</p>

<p>
This evening they are both sitting by the open window
overlooking the Rhine.  In these hot summer nights
Lauraine has cast aside her heavy black dresses, and wears
chiefly white, with knots of black ribbon here and there.
Lady Etwynde thinks how lovely she looks, sitting there,
with the sunrays touching her dusky hair, her soft snowy
gown, her slender hands that are idly folded on her lap.
</p>

<p>
Instinctively she comes forward and kneels by her side.
"Am I to go, Lauraine?" she asks, softly.
</p>

<p>
For all answer Lauraine clasps her round the neck, and
bursts into tears.  "No, no; a thousand times no!"
she cries, weeping.  "You are the only one left to me to
love.  Don't leave me quite desolate."
</p>

<p>
"I will not," answers Lady Etwynde, softly.  "I
wish I could be of some use&mdash;of some help; but in these
cases the tenderest sympathy seems to hurt.  No one
can help us."
</p>

<p>
"You speak as if you too had 'loved and lost'?"
says Lauraine, wiping the tears from her eyes, and looking
at the beautiful, noble face beside her.
</p>

<p>
A faint warmth of colour comes over it; the proud
head, with its golden halo of hair, droops a little.  "Yes,"
she says, "I have.  Sometimes I think it was my own
fault, after all I was too proud, too exacting.  Shall I
tell you the story?  Would you care to hear?"
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, I would," said Lauraine, earnestly.
</p>

<p>
"He was a soldier," begins Lady Etwynde.  "I
was seventeen; romantic to my finger-tips.  He, thirty
years or more; bronzed, bold, stalwart, a king among
men, I always thought.  We met at my first season in
London, loved, were engaged.  He was of good
family, but not rich.  My parents objected strongly
at first; but I was their only child, and they had
never crossed whim or wish of mine.  Of course I gained
my point.  Oh, how happy I was!  It was like all the
ecstasy of dreams, all the fancies of poets, all the purity
and waking passion of first love steeping my life in golden
glamour.  I only lived, watched, thought for him, and
he&mdash;all the time&mdash;he deceived me!"
</p>

<p>
Her voice breaks.  The bitterness and anguish of that
time seems present over again.  The colour fades from
her cheeks as she kneels there in the radiant moonlight.
</p>

<p>
"No man comes to thirty years of age without a 'past'
of some sort," she resumes.  "But I, in my childish
ignorance, imagined him another Bayard.  He had been
so brave, his name was crowned with so many laurels.
He seemed the very soul of honour, of truth, and I&mdash;I
loved him so.  And one night, oh, shall I ever forget
that night?  We had gone down to Richmond to dinner.
We had been out on the river afterwards.  It was a warm
June night, so fair, so still, so fragrant, and he rowed the
boat himself and the rest of the party left us far behind.
Suddenly another boat passed us; there were two men
in it, and a woman.  I remember noticing she had
something scarlet wrapped about her and was very dark;
foreign-looking I fancied.  They were rowing fast, their
boat shot by.  I heard a cry, the sound of a name&mdash;<i>his</i>
name&mdash;and he was sitting before me, his face white as
death, his eyes full of horror and doubt.  'Good God!'
I heard him cry, 'and she is <i>not</i> dead?'
</p>

<p>
"My heart seemed to stand still.  Then I grew very
calm and cold.  'Who is that woman, Cyril?'  He
stared at me like one in a dream, and turned the boat
back without a word and rowed me to the hotel.  Then
he led me up one of the quiet river walks, and standing
there before me told me the whole sickening, miserable
tale.  There may have been extenuation in it.  I saw
none.  I was young and ignorant of life and of men, and
cruel, I suppose.  He called me so.  I could only cling
to one fact&mdash;that she had been his wife.  What mattered
to me the folly, the caprice, the infatuation that had
chained his hot youth and held him powerless now?
What mattered to me anything, anything, save that he
was lost to me, that my idol was shattered, my heart was
broken.  'You told me you had loved no other woman
as you loved me,' I said, scornfully; 'and all the time, all
the time, you had given her the surest, truest proof of
love a man can give.  Pity!  No, I have no pity!  You
made your choice, you must abide by it.  If you were
free this hour I would not marry you now.  You have
deceived me.  Your love was a pretence; perhaps you
call it also such names as you have called hers.  Go to
her, your wife; I never will voluntarily look upon your
face again.'  Oh, Lauraine, was I cruel, was I unjust;
God knows.  Oh, the bitterness, the agony, the shame
of that night.  I felt as if I hated him in the new sharp
fever of jealousy that had come to my heart.  I hated
to think he had belonged to another, held her to his heart,
kissed her, loved or seemed to love her.  My whole nature
seemed to change.  I could only think he had deceived
me, whether willingly, or mercifully did not matter.
Love, youth, joy, hope, all seemed to die out of my heart.
Nothing he said seemed to soften me.  I would not listen,
I would not yield, I would not pity.  He left me, and I
never saw him again.  The next news I had was that
he had gone abroad on foreign service.  I had seen his
name from time to time, but of his life, the life I once
so fondly hoped to share, I know nothing!"
</p>

<p>
Lauraine touches the trembling hands.  "You were
hard on him, I think," she says gently.  "I suppose he
thought her dead&mdash;that he was free."
</p>

<p>
"He said so," answers Lady Etwynde.  "Oh, yes,
and doubtless he believed it.  He could not have dared
to offer such an insult to me, or my family.  But what I
resented was that he should have kept the story back,
that he should have pretended that I was his first, his
only love, and all the time <i>she</i> had been his wife.  I could
not forgive that!"
</p>

<p>
"But, my dear," says Lauraine, gently, "you may
have had his first <i>real</i> love.  The other was but a
youthful folly, a hot-headed infatuation.  Does any man
come to us with his heart pure and free?  Few, I think,
if any.  We cannot judge them by ourselves.  That is
how so many women wreck their lives.  They expect too
much.  No man can ever be what a girl's dreams would
make him.  But it is so hard for her to believe that."
</p>

<p>
"I know it now," answers Lady Etwynde.  "I have
learnt my lesson in bitterness and grief.  But I think
it has done me good.  I have forgiven him long ago.  I
shall never see him again to tell him so, I suppose;
perhaps he would not care even to hear it.  But I am
happier since I could pardon and pity his weakness,
only&mdash;my Bayard he could never be again!"
</p>

<p>
"And of her?  Do you know anything about her
fate?" asks Lauraine, forgetful of her own sorrows in
this new interest.
</p>

<p>
"I heard she was dead.  She was a vile, cruel woman.
He divorced her afterwards, but what was that to me?
What can anything be to me now that concerns his name,
his life?"  There comes a long silence.  The thoughts of
both are busy with sad memories.  As Lauraine looks
at Lady Etwynde's face she sees it is full of pain, but
her eyes have a dreamy look, as the eyes of one who
sees some sweet vision afar off.
</p>

<p>
"I was wrong, I suppose," she says, slowly.  "A
woman who loves must forget <i>herself</i> in that love, and I,
I thought too much of my wounded pride, my lost ideal.
But I have never held a thought of love for any other
man.  The lips that he kissed were his first, they will be
his for ever.  I have never forgotten; and now I am
thirty years old, and my parents, as you know, are dead,
and I live alone, and am looked upon as a marvel of
eccentricity, and have my school of apostles and fool
them to the top of their bent.  Sometimes life seems a
horrible travesty of all that is dignified and pure, and
sometimes a jest that one laughs at and forgets.  But no
one knows me as I really am, save you, Lauraine.  To
most people I suppose I hardly seem a woman.  But
my true self and my lost love live a life apart, a life of
dreams, sad but yet beautiful.  A life that feeds itself
on memories, memories that are recalled by the colours
of every changing sky, the scents of leaf and flower that
touch one like a sound of music.  Ah! those nights,
those mornings, those scenes that are the same, yet <i>not</i>
the same, how they make one's whole soul sick with
longing, and mad with regret!"
</p>

<p>
"And you have borne all this so long?" says Lauraine,
wonderingly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she answers; "it seems long, does it not?
And I have not pined away much.  I don't look like a
love-lorn maiden, do I?  I have not gone into a decline,
or fallen away to a shadow, or grown grey with sorrow, or
done anything I ought to have done according to
romancers.  I suppose no one I know ever suspects that I
have had a love-story, much less that I cherish its memory."
</p>

<p>
"Your nature must be a very constant one," says
Lauraine.  "You make me ashamed of myself.  No
wonder Keith reproaches me with unfaithfulness."
</p>

<p>
"I think fidelity is an established instinct," says Lady
Etwynde.  "It is very much an accident of our own
natures.  To me, it seems an utter impossibility to even
think of caring for another man.  Cyril Carlisle was my
first lover; I gave him all that was in me to give.  It
was all my life to me.  I suppose&mdash;to him&mdash;it was but
another experience."
</p>

<p>
"Yours is a grand nature," says Lauraine, looking
wonderingly at the calm, noble face.  "You shame me
for myself.  If I had but kept true a little space&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"One can never judge of another's case by one's own,"
answers Lady Etwynde.  "No doubt you were tried,
hurried into it.  I know, oh! I know.  You are not the
first girl who has told me the same, nor will you be the
last.  The mothers of Society do it all for the best,
doubtless.  Love seems such a poor, contemptible thing
in their eyes in comparison with&mdash;settlements.  Oh,
yes! that is so always.  Perhaps they forget their own
youth; one does, they say, when one outlives romance.
And I suppose an 'Establishment' is better than poetry
any day.  They are wise, after all.  Year after year
the season has its martyrs.  Girls are brought out and
introduced with no higher aim or object set before them
than a 'great marriage.'  Fashion and Society expect
it.  I suppose it is what they were born for!  Thank
God! my parents were neither ambitious nor mercenary.
Perhaps I too might have been over-persuaded.  I don't
think it likely.  Still&mdash;-"
</p>

<p>
She hesitates and looks compassionately at Lauraine's
sad face.  "You must try and be brave, dear, and bear
your life as it is.  Regrets, repining, sorrowing won't
make it any better.  You say you are weak, but I don't
think you are so weak as all that.  And there is one
thing I have wanted to say to you of late.  You will
pardon me if it seems intrusive.  But, do you know
you are behaving very coldly, and, I think, unwisely,
towards your husband?  You leave him alone, to other
temptations that your presence would restrain.  All
these months you have not seen him, you scarcely even
write with more warmth or interest than you do to your
steward; and, after all, he is your husband.  Nothing
can alter that; and he loved you very dearly, and no
doubt he does still.  Can you not see that your duty to
him demands even more than the sacrifice you have
already made?  I know it is hard, terribly hard.  You
say there is no sympathy, no comprehension between
you, and your heart is aching with this forbidden love,
and he must seem in a way hateful; but you were not
honest with him quite, if you promised to marry him, and
yet held back your heart.  You see what I mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," Lauraine says faintly, "I see."
</p>

<p>
"Duty demands much, but it also repays much,",
continues Lady Etwynde gently.  "Heaven knows
I am not fit to preach to you; but in the world, as we
know it, Lauraine, there are so many faithless wives, so
many divided households.  Oh, my dear, don't you add
to the number!  You have many enemies of whom you
know nothing, and they would gladly seize your name,
and smirch its purity with scandals, and whispers, and
evil words.  I want you to be brave, and face them all,
and live out your life nobly and well.  I know I am
bidding you do a hard thing; but it is right, and I am
sure you see it."
</p>

<p>
Lauraine bends her head down wearily, and lays it on
her friend's shoulder.  She feels spent, tired, exhausted.
The tears throng to her eyes, her heart aches with dull and
ceaseless pain.  "I do see it!" she half sobs.  "I will try."
</p>

<p>
"May Heaven give you strength!" murmurs Lady
Etwynde, and she kisses her on the brow.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII
</h3>

<p>
It seems strange and painful to Lauraine to go back to
the gaiety and brilliance of Baden after the quiet and
rest of pretty, picturesque little Bingen.
</p>

<p>
A large party of her old friends and acquaintances
are at the Badischer Hof, and her husband meets her at
the station.  Lady Etwynde has returned to England.
</p>

<p>
"You are not looking well," says Sir Francis.  "And
how thin you have become."
</p>

<p>
"I have not been very strong; this hot weather tries
me so," she answers; and then they enter their carriage
and drive to the hotel in the cool, sweet September
twilight.  Lauraine forces herself to talk, to try and appear
interested in the forthcoming race; but the sense of
strangeness produced by long absence and utter want
of sympathy with each other's tastes and pursuits makes
itself felt again and again.  It is a relief when she finds
herself alone in her own room.  But with Lady Etwynde's
words ringing in her ears, with her new resolves firm and
close to her heart, she will not listen to whispers of
distaste and discontent.  She enters more into the business
of her toilette than she has done since her child's death.
She astonishes her maid by her critical objections.  When
she descends she looks like the Lauraine of old.  Her
cheeks are flushed with excitement, her eyes burn with
feverish brilliancy.  Her soft, snowy robes seem to
make her beauty more fair, more young, more pathetic.
The first person to greet her is the Lady Jean&mdash;Lady
Jean, handsomer, if a little louder and stouter than ever,
arrayed in a wonderful Louis Quatorze costume, with
glittering steel buttons and ornaments.  Consistent
with her new <i>rôle</i>, Lauraine greets her very cordially, and
even smiles with less repugnance on "Jo," who is one
of her special detestations, and who looks even uglier,
and more Jewish than of yore.
</p>

<p>
They are a very brilliant party assembled here, and
the theme on every tongue is the coming race, and the
wonderful English racer owned by Sir Francis.  Lauraine
wonders a little to find the women apparently as
conversant with racecourse slang as the men&mdash;at the
fluency with which Lady Jean discourses on "training,"
and "hedging," and "running form," and "hard
condition."  It seems so long since she was with women
of this sort, women who ape the "lords of creation" in
manners, dress, and morals, that she feels bewildered and
out of place amidst them all.
</p>

<p>
When dinner is over they saunter out to the Kursaal.
The band is playing, the <i>salons</i> are crowded.  The lights
sparkle amid the trees, and fall on fair faces and lovely
toilettes, on sovereigns of the <i>demi-monde</i>, supreme and
defiant; on other sovereigns and celebrities, quite
unobtrusive, undistinguished.  They mingle with the crowd.
Lady Jean, Sir Francis, and Lauraine are walking on
a little in advance of the others.  A fountain is throwing
up showers of silver spray, the white gleam of a statue
shines through the foliage; on the chairs beneath the
trees two people are sitting&mdash;a man and a woman.
</p>

<p>
The light falls on her face: it is very lovely, though
owing much to art.  Her hair is of too vivid a gold to be
quite natural; the great grey eyes are swept by lashes
many shades darker than their original hue.  She is
talking and laughing loudly.  The man leans carelessly
back on his seat, tilting it to an angle that threatens its
upset and his own.  Perhaps it is that fact, reminding
her so of a trick of Keith's, that makes Lauraine look a
second time.  Her heart gives a wild throb, she feels cold
and sick with a sudden shame.
</p>

<p>
She sees it is Keith himself....
</p>

<p>
Just as they pass, the tilted chair is pulled back to its
level with a ringing laugh.
</p>

<p>
"I declare to you it's impossible to speak when you
will not look," says a shrill French voice.
</p>

<p>
His eyes go straight to that passing figure.  He starts,
and his face grows darkly red.  The eyes meet for a
second's space.  In hers is pained rebuke, in his&mdash;shame.
There is no word, no sign of recognition.  But
all the night seems full of dizzy pain to Keith.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"It is very annoying," murmurs Lady Jean the next
morning, as she sits at the breakfast-table.  "Why
could they not have gone somewhere else?"
</p>

<p>
"What is annoying?" questions Lauraine, looking
up from her chicken cutlets at the clouded, handsome
face opposite.
</p>

<p>
"Why, those Americans; one meets them everywhere!
Hortense tells me they arrived last night&mdash;that
Woollffe woman, you know, and her niece; and they
have the next rooms to mine; and, of course, we will
meet them everywhere; and oh! I am so sick of them,
you can't imagine!"
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Woollffe is a very kind-hearted woman,"
murmurs Lauraine.  She is pale and languid, and her eyes
have a weary, sleepless look in them that tells of many
hours of wakefulness.  She and Lady Jean are alone.
</p>

<p>
"Kind-hearted!" echoes Lady Jean.  "My dear,
so is our greengrocer's wife, or our dressmaker, for all
we know; but that is no reason why we should receive
them in our drawing-rooms.  Now, I have done my best
to avoid this dreadful woman, for two seasons, and here
she is, next door to me!"
</p>

<p>
"You are not bound to associate with her, if you are
so exclusive," says Lauraine, a little contemptuously.
"But there are many women received in society who
have not half the honesty and sterling worth of
Mrs. Bradshaw Woollffe."
</p>

<p>
"Of course," laughs Lady Jean, with unfeigned amusement;
"but honesty and sterling worth are rather humdrum
things, don't you think?  And she is <i>so</i> vulgar!"
</p>

<p>
"That should be a recommendation, I fancy," says
Lauraine.  "Almost every one is vulgar nowadays."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, but there is a distinction!  When a woman
is really well born, and has an established position, she
may do what she likes.  It is these mushroom millionaires,
these <i>nouveaux riches</i>, with their lined pockets and
their 'piles,' made out of every imaginable horror,
adulterating, swindling, coal-mining, shoe-blacking, heaven
only knows what, that are so odious and yet so formidable
a power!  They push, they struggle, they scheme,
they spend their money like water, they have a craze for
society, the very highest, the very best.  They take our
snubs and insults, and flatter and fawn just the same
only for a card in their halls, a half-hour passage through
their drawing-rooms, the honour and glory of a 'name'
to figure in a society journal as one of their guests.
Faugh! it is sickening!"
</p>

<p>
"But the society who eats and drinks and amuses itself
at their expense is alone to blame," says Lauraine
calmly.  "If people had sufficient dignity and self-respect
to oppose such innovations, to keep these people
at a distance, they could not force themselves in."
</p>

<p>
"But they are always so abominably rich," laughs
Lady Jean.  "That excuses so much, you see; and then
they let us treat them pretty much as we please.  It is
a case of get all you want, give what you like."
</p>

<p>
"To me that always seems a very mean doctrine,"
says Lauraine gravely.
</p>

<p>
"Do you treat Mrs. Bradshaw Woollffe as an equal,
then?" asks Lady Jean ironically.
</p>

<p>
"If you mean do I know her one day and cut her the
next, do I go to her balls and be blind when we pass in
the Row, I must say&mdash;no.  She comes to my house, I
go to hers.  She was extremely kind to me in Rome,
and I never forget kindness.  She is not very ladylike,
I acknowledge, but I should be sorry to hurt her feelings
because of that.  I do not consider a lady can ever affect
her own dignity by her behaviour to those whom
society counts her inferiors.  For my part I like to be
consistent.  If we receive such people on account of their
wealth, we take them at their own valuation.  We have
no right to smile on them one minute and insult them
the next."
</p>

<p>
"You were always peculiar," says Lady Jean, with
some asperity.  "I suppose that comes of high principles
and poetic fancies.  I always go where I can be amused
myself.  It is the best thing to do after all."
</p>

<p>
"To amuse oneself?" questions Lauraine.  "And afterwards?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, after that&mdash;the deluge," laughs Lady Jean,
shaking out the countless lace ruffles and frills of her
cambric morning gown.  "I could not take life <i>au grand
sérieux</i>; it would kill me.  Oh, I know what you would
say.  Excitement is frivolous, useless, wearing to our
nerves, destruction to health and beauty.  Perhaps so.
But you are blessed with a serene temperament; I am
not.  I like to live, to enjoy, to be in one whirl from
morning till night.  I don't care about long life, peace,
tranquillity.  No, I want all I can, <i>while</i> I can."
</p>

<p>
Lauraine looks at her curiously.  She knows very little
of Lady Jean&mdash;only just so much as one woman in
society does know of another who moves in the same
set, dances at the same balls, pursues the same routine
of enjoyments.  But she knows she is popular and
admired, on good terms with the world at large, and an
immense favourite with men.
</p>

<p>
"You don't agree with me, of course?" pursues Lady
Jean, sipping her claret, and looking amusedly at
Lauraine's grave face.  "I suppose you have aims and
ambitions and 'views' like your friend Lady Etwynde?
What a curious thing, by the way, that she should be a
friend of yours, or indeed, of anybody's except a
peacock.  She must be dreadfully uninteresting!"
</p>

<p>
"I think her charming," answers Lauraine.  "She
is one of the few true women it has been my lot to meet."
</p>

<p>
Lady Jean feels a little uncomfortable.  She has long
passed the stage of blushing, or she would feel the colour
mounting as she meets Lauraine's calm, frank gaze.
</p>

<p>
"Is there any <i>arrière pensée</i>?" she thinks.  "Is she
less blind than we imagine?"
</p>

<p>
"I can't imagine a woman getting enthusiastic <i>about</i>
a woman," she says coolly.  "Seems unnatural.  Of
course, I have no doubt the æsthetic is very charming to
those who can appreciate her.  I never could."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose not.  I should scarcely think you had
much in common," answers Lauraine dryly.
</p>

<p>
"Still," says Lady Jean, rising carelessly from the
table, "it was a little odd and unnatural that you should
go away with her, and leave your poor husband all to
himself.  If he hadn't been one of the most
good-natured men&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Pardon me," interrupts Lauraine, very coldly, "I
would rather not discuss my husband with anybody.
You may rest assured I had his full sanction for my
'unnatural' conduct.  And, if you know anything of a
mother's feelings at all, you might suppose that I scarcely
felt inclined for the gaieties and frivolities of London life
after so sad a trial."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, yes; I forgot&mdash;the poor little angel," murmurs
Lady Jean, her eyelids drooping to hide the angry flash
in her black eyes.  "But&mdash;I may be wrong&mdash;I don't
know, only to me it always seemed that a wife's first duty
was to her husband."
</p>

<p>
"Pray, has my husband been complaining of me?"
inquires Lauraine haughtily.
</p>

<p>
Lady Jean smiles involuntarily.  "My dear, no, of
course not.  I only said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I quite understand," says Lauraine.  "Perhaps I
was selfish in my grief.  I don't know.  I had not meant
to be; but he chose the world, and I, solitude.  I should
not be so unwise again, rest assured."
</p>

<p>
"What does she mean?" says Lady Jean to herself
uncomfortably.  "And how strange she looked.
Surely, surely, she cannot suspect!"
</p>

<p>
An hour afterwards she is strolling with Sir Francis
through the grounds of the Kursaal.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Mon cher</i>," she says, with a little mocking laugh,
"I do believe your wife is jealous.  It is very amusing,
but you had better be careful all the same.  I object to
be one in a <i>chronique scandaleuse</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Lauraine jealous?" exclaims Sir Francis.  "What
put that idea in your head?"
</p>

<p>
"She herself," answers Lady Jean.  "She says for
the future she will not be so neglectful of you.  She is
afraid she left you too much alone.  Is not that charming
news?  Does it not arouse very sweet emotions?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't talk folly, Jean," mutters Sir Francis
savagely.  "You know, or ought to know, how much I care
for Lauraine.  A poor, weak, milk-and-water creature.
Heavens! how could I have ever fancied myself in love
with her?"
</p>

<p>
"But you were, you know," says Lady Jean calmly.
"Only, like all men, you deny it when your fickle fancy
changes.  It is always the <i>last</i> who is the only real love."
</p>

<p>
"I know well enough who is my real love, last or first,"
he says hoarsely; and his eyes flash bold, ardent admiration
at her, under the drooping foliage of the trees.
</p>

<p>
"Hush!" she whispers, and with a warning glance
around.  "You must not say such words&mdash;in public!"
</p>

CHAPTER XIX
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  We whisper, and hint, and chuckle,<br>
  And grin at a brother's shame.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Lauraine sees no more of Keith during the next week,
but she hears from Mrs. Woollffe that he has gone to the
Black Forest.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what's come to him," complains the
garrulous American.  "Guess he's off his head
sometimes.  Those dollars have been an unlucky windfall
for him.  He's not like the same chap he was in New
York.  He never looks pleased noway, and he was the
merriest, larkiest young fellow any one could wish to see
when I knew him first.  I thought Nan would wake
him up a bit, but she don't seem to answer; and now
he's run off from Baden-Baden as if it was a den of
rattlesnakes; and they do say (she drops her voice
mysteriously) that he's with that notorious Frenchwoman
Coralie Lafitte.  My word, if that's so, won't she make
the dollars fly.  All the same, I'm uncommon sorry for
Keith.  Never thought he was one of <i>that</i> sort."
</p>

<p>
Lauraine grows hot and cold with shame as she listens.
She had thought there would be nothing harder for her
to do after giving him up, after that last sad parting; but
to hear of his recklessness, his sins, to know that she may
be in a measure to blame for both cuts her to the heart.
</p>

<p>
She sits quite silent, her hands busy with some crewel-work
that she is doing.  Mrs. Bradshaw B. Woollffe is
paying her a morning visit.  Lady Jean has fled at the
first approach of the enemy, and so Lauraine has to
entertain her alone.  Mrs. Woollffe talks on, on; but her
listener hears nothing of what she says.  Her thoughts are
only with the man whose life she has wrecked.  Her
storm-shattered heart aches and throbs with memories freshly
brought to life.  She has done what was right; she has
severed her life from his, but if it makes him evil,
desperate, hopeless; if it sends him to profligate men
and bad women, if his bright young manhood is laid
waste and desolate, was it, could it be right, after all?
</p>

<p>
Her influence, her presence, had always been a restraint
upon him, and she had denied him both&mdash;cast him out
to the fire of temptations, the recklessness of despair.
</p>

<p>
It was a horrible thought; no one knows how horrible
save a woman whose soul is pure, whose heart is
passionate, who sees the life she loves and fain would bless,
pass out and away from her keeping, and knows that it
is beyond her power to recall or claim its fidelity; who
sees it lose itself in evil, and seek forgetfulness in wild
and feverish excitements, and knows that a word, one
little word might have held it back and kept it safe and
unharmed.
</p>

<p>
"I must not think of it, I <i>must</i> not," she says to
herself in scorn; and she looks up from the tangled
crewels and tries to interest herself in Mrs. Bradshaw
Woollffe's gossip, and promises to drive with her in the
Lichtenthal Allée, forgetful of Lady Jean's disgust.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'll go," says her loquacious friend at last.
"Guess I've got heaps of shopping to do this morning,
and Nan will be that cross for keeping her waiting!
Good-bye, my dear; good-bye.  Hope I haven't tired
you.  Four o'clock then."
</p>

<p>
The door closes; Lauraine is alone.  She sinks wearily
back in her chair.  The silks and canvas fall unheeded
to the floor.  She is afraid of this new pain that has come
to her&mdash;this jealous hatred and horror of the woman who
is holding Keith in her evil bondage.  Her strength
seems all fled.  The long, empty, colourless days that
stretch before her, that have to be lived through, look
doubly dreary in this hour.  "I thought the worst
bitterness of my cup had passed my lips," she moans.
"I had not thought of this."
</p>

<p>
Her husband had asked her carelessly about Keith,
and she had spoken of that brief meeting in the Tyrolean
valley.  Sir Francis had not heard of his being at Baden at
all.  A sort of dread comes over her as she thinks of the
chance of other meetings, of the added pain that each
fresh account of his actions may bring her.  He had,
indeed, known how to make her suffer, and the suffering
could have no anodyne now.
</p>

<p>
With an effort she calms herself at last.  Her hours of
solitude are few, and she must appear her usual calm,
grave self to the friends who are about and with her
daily life.  They see no change in her to-day.  Even Lady
Jean's sharp eyes detect no difference; but the laughter,
the chatter, the gay banter, the naughty stories, all seem
dull and far-off to her ears.  She marvels whether these men
and women have hearts to feel, or souls to suffer?
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It is the day of the race.  A day warm and brilliant
with sunshine, cooled by a fresh soft breeze, that brings
all the scents of the pine forests in its breath, and stirs
the fluttering laces and ribbons of the women's toilettes,
and the waving flags that stream from the Pavilion and
the Grand Stand and other points of vantage.
</p>

<p>
Lady Jean and her husband, Sir Francis and Lauraine,
come in the same carriage.  As the ladies descend and
sweep along the pretty grass-covered course they come
face to face with Mrs. Bradshaw Woollffe, her niece, and
Keith Athelstone.
</p>

<p>
Lady Jean's presence gives Lauraine fair excuse.
They only exchange bows and pass on.  She marvels
that she feels so calm, that neither flush nor pallor
betrays what the sight of that young, haggard, weary face
is to her.  She is annoyed to see him here, having heard
no word from his staunch ally.  Afraid of a second
meeting, she begs her husband to take her to her seat.
Lady Jean grumbles, but the men are eager to be off
to the enclosure, where the hero of the day, Aldebert, is
calmly awaiting the important moment when he is to
make or mar the fortunes of those who support him.
</p>

<p>
"You have no bets on?" says Lady Jean to Lauraine,
as they sit side by side, and survey the glittering scene,
all life and light and colour now.
</p>

<p>
"No, not even a solitary pair of gloves," smiles
Lauraine.  "To tell you the truth, I never thought about
it.  Betting seems stupid."
</p>

<p>
"You appear to think most things stupid that other
women do," says Lady Jean tartly.  She has a great
deal more than gloves on this race, and Lauraine's speech
annoys her.  "Good gracious! here comes that awful
woman again.  Lauraine, you must change places; let
me get on your other side.  I should positively die if I
had to sit next her for a quarter of an hour."
</p>

<p>
She rises impulsively from her seat.  Lauraine does
the same.  There is a little bustle, a little laughter, a
chatter of tongues, and then Lauraine finds herself with
Keith Athelstone, instead of Mrs. Bradshaw Woollffe,
by her side.
</p>

<p>
It is impossible to avoid shaking hands with him now,
and she does so.  Neither of them speaks, however;
but the constraint is not noticed by the rest of the party,
for the horses are coming out of the enclosure now, and
every eye turns to the starting point.
</p>

<p>
Aldebert wins the race; but to Lauraine everything
seems confused and indistinct, and in comparison with
Lady Jean's excitement and delight at Sir Francis'
success, her own manner seems strangely cold and
unconcerned.  Amidst the hubbub and excitement, the
noise of voices and shouts of congratulation, Keith
bends nearer to Lauraine.
</p>

<p>
"I have some news that will please you, I hope," he
says.  "I am going to marry Nan, as you advised me."
</p>

<p>
For one startled instant Lauraine is quite unable to
speak or move.  She feels the hot blood surging to her
brain; she turns dizzy and faint.  But the importance
of self-command is present to her mind.  She forces
herself to appear as little moved as possible.  Her voice is
perfectly calm as she says: "I am glad to hear it.  Pray
accept my congratulations."
</p>

<p>
And then Sir Francis joins them, and there are more
congratulations and a great deal of noise and excitement,
and Mrs. Bradshaw Woollffe and her party leave the
stand and go down to the pretty racecourse, and Lauraine
sees Keith by the side of Miss Anastasia J. Jefferson,
and wonders is she dreaming&mdash;is all this real?  For her
the gay scene is altogether dull and wearisome.  Turn
where she will, look where she may, she only sees that
haggard young face, only hears the shrill, ringing laugh
of the pretty American, whom every one calls "Dresden
China," and who looks like a dainty little Watteau
shepherdess in her flowered silk costume and big hat,
and piled up sunny curls.
</p>

<p>
Long before the close of that day the news is on every
tongue.  The young millionaire is going to marry
"Dresden China," and Lady Jean looks maliciously at
Lauraine, and laughs and nods her head mysteriously,
saying she'll believe it when she sees it.
</p>

<p>
"Too sudden to be much good," she says, as they
discuss the event that evening at dinner.  "Though she's
been spoons on him for ever so long."
</p>

<p>
"She's awfully pretty," remarks Sir Francis.  "Why
shouldn't he care for her?"
</p>

<p>
"No reason why he shouldn't.  I only say he doesn't,"
answers Lady Jean.
</p>

<p>
"So much the better," says an <i>attaché</i> to the Austrian
Legation, who makes one of the party.  "Love matches
are a mistake.  Never yet knew one turn out well."
</p>

<p>
"Poor Keith," says Lady Jean.  "Fancy tied to
those dreadful people.  Her father sold rum and molasses,
didn't he, in New Orleans; and she says 'guess,'
and 'spry,' and 'cunning.'  And then the aunt."
</p>

<p>
"I don't think their colloquialisms are worse than
our slang," says Lauraine coldly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I know you are enthusiastic on American
subjects," says Lady Jean meaningly.  "I beg your
pardon for my remarks."
</p>

<p>
"There is no necessity," Lauraine answers, looking
at her with calm surprise.  "I know you dislike
Mrs. Woollffe, and of course you are not bound to
acknowledge her niece&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"As Mrs. Athelstone," interrupts Lady Jean.  "No,
I suppose not&mdash;only for Keith's sake&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She pauses.  Lauraine feels the colour mounting to her
brow.  There is something so irritating in this patronage
and she knows that Lady Jean is about the last person
who ought to talk of a <i>mésalliance</i>.
</p>

<p>
"I thought you said just now that she would never
be that," she says very coldly.  "Your words and
opinions seem somewhat inconsistent."
</p>

<p>
"I shall be very much surprised if she ever is,"
responds Lady Jean.  "All the same, one ought to
prepare for the worst."
</p>

<p>
Good-humoured as is her speech, light as is her
laughter, Lauraine feels that there is a covert meaning
in both.
</p>

<p>
She would have known she was right could she have
heard the conversation between Sir Francis and herself
later on that evening.  After the fatigue of the drive
to Iffezheim and the excitement of the races the whole
party profess to be too tired for anything but a quiet
evening of "loo," mingled with music and gossip and
cigarettes.  Then Sir Francis saunters over to where
Lady Jean sits&mdash;her dark, picturesque beauty looking
its best in the mellow lamp-light.
</p>

<p>
"What did you mean to-night by your remarks
about young Athelstone?" he asks abruptly.
</p>

<p>
Lady Jean gives him one quick glance of her flashing eyes.
"Mean? nothing, of course.  What <i>should</i> I mean?"
</p>

<p>
"That's just what I want to know.  You don't think
he cares for this girl?"
</p>

<p>
"Not the value of a brass farthing!"
</p>

<p>
"But you think&mdash;&mdash;!"
</p>

<p>
"My dear old donkey, I <i>think</i>&mdash;of course I think.  I
keep my eyes open, which you don't.  I know a little
sum in arithmetic called two and two, which you, I dare
say, have long forgotten.  That is all."
</p>

<p>
"I wish I knew what you were driving at," mutters
Sir Francis sulkily.
</p>

<p>
"What should I be 'driving at'?" asks Lady Jean
innocently.  "Only when a young man has been entirely
devoted to one woman, and then without rhyme or
reason suddenly proposes to another for whom he
doesn't care a straw, then&mdash;well, the little sum in
arithmetic comes in useful.  That is all."
</p>

<p>
Sir Francis looks at her half in anger, half in perplexity.
</p>

<p>
"That's the devil of women," he says with impatience.
"They hint and hint, and won't speak out."
</p>

<p>
"And that's the&mdash;ahem&mdash;of men," laughs Lady Jean.
"They see, and see, and remain so blind."
</p>

<p>
"I have seen nothing."
</p>

<p>
"So much the better for you," says Lady Jean, with
a shrug of her handsome shoulders.  "You might have
been annoyed, or uncomfortable; most likely the latter.
You have not my secret of taking things lightly.  Now,
if I saw you making love under my very eyes I should
only be amused, or think what bad taste you had to
prefer any other woman to me.  <i>On se console toujours,
mon ami</i>.  You do it one way, Lauraine another, I
another.  But I suppose we each have our own views
on the subject of the consolation, or&mdash;consoler!"
</p>

<p>
And she laughs again: soft, amused, pleasant laughter,
that seems to hold no malice, to be the outspring of no
evil thought.  And all the time her heart is full of both.
For, as virtue shames vice, and purity shows up the grosser
contrast of immorality, so she feels ashamed and rebuked
by the words and presence of Lauraine.  "If ever two
people loved, they love," she had said to herself that past
season; and now it had all come to nothing.  There was
no hold over Lauraine, no <i>petite histoire</i>, nothing to
smile and sneer at.
</p>

<p>
"If she had only compromised herself ever so little,"
she thinks to-night as she looks at the lovely calm face,
the grave dark eyes.  "And now this projected marriage.
It is awfully queer.  If she had been like other women."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XX
</h3>

<p>
"The old place is just the same, isn't it?" says one tall
bearded man to another, as they stand at the window
of the Naval and Military Club, and look out at the
lighted streets in the grey November dusk.
</p>

<p>
The man addressed turns his keen dark eyes on his
companion's face.  "The same&mdash;yes, I suppose it is.
It's only people who change, you know.  Places and
things haven't their excuse."
</p>

<p>
"Well, changed or not, I'm glad to be back again,"
says Major Trentermain of the Twelfth.  He and his
friend, Colonel Carlisle, have just returned from Burmah,
and are enjoying the comforts of club-life, the reunion
with old friends, the hundred-and-one things that,
familiar enough once, have become of double value since
sacrificed for the exigencies of foreign service, and lost
through years of hard work and fierce warfare, and the
myriad discomforts of climate and life abroad.
</p>

<p>
"London is the best place in the world to enjoy life in,"
continues Trentermain.  "I've been looking up old
friends to-day.  Such welcomes!  Didn't expect to find
so many in town.  But the country's beastly just now;
even the hunting's spoilt by the weather."
</p>

<p>
"Old friends," echoes his companion drearily.
"I wonder if I've got any left.  I feel like a Methuselah
come back; it seems a lifetime since I went abroad."
</p>

<p>
He passes his hand over his short-cut iron-grey hair,
and half sighs.  He is a splendid-looking man.  Tall,
erect, powerful, with keen dark eyes and a heavy drooping
moustache, dark still in contrast to his hair&mdash;a man
who carries his forty-five years lightly enough, despite
hard service and trying climate.  His eyes gaze out on
the darkening streets, where the lamps are shining, and
his thoughts go back to some thirteen years before, to
a time of fierce joy and fiercer suffering.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder where <i>she</i> is now?" he thinks to himself.
"Pshaw! married, of course, long ago.  I wonder I
have not forgotten her.  Thirteen years of such a life as
mine ought to knock all memories and romance out of one."
</p>

<p>
He laughs a little bitterly and impatiently, and then
plunges into a discussion with his friend, which resolves
itself into an arrangement to dine and go to the theatre
together afterwards.
</p>

<p>
"I have promised to look in at Vane's rooms," says
Major Trentermain.  "You'll come too, won't you?
He is full of some new craze&mdash;æstheticism, he calls it.
All his people have gone in for it extensively, and he seems
to be bitten with the same mania.  You really should
see his rooms.  Quite a study."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes; I'll come," answers Carlisle indifferently.
He is rarely anything else but indifferent now.
Nothing rouses or interests him except, perhaps, "big
game" or hard fighting.
</p>

<p>
They go to the Gaiety.  To Carlisle the performance
seems idiotic in the extreme.
</p>

<p>
"Do come away.  I can't stand this trash," he
mutters impatiently.
</p>

<p>
"But that's Belle Burton singing," remonstrates
Trentermain, who is more "up" to the goings on of
London as it is, than his friend.
</p>

<p>
"What of that?" demands Carlisle.
</p>

<p>
"Every one's talking of her.  She's&mdash;&mdash;" (Then
comes a mysterious whisper.)  Colonel Carlisle frowns
and tugs his heavy moustache.
</p>

<p>
"Vice idealized as 'celebrity.'  Umph!  That's a
modern definition?  Suppose I'm old-fashioned enough
to look upon it as it is.  Come, you can't really care for
such rubbish, Trent.  It's an insult to common sense, I
think.  And look at that row of vapid idiots grinning
from ear to ear&mdash;boys with the <i>blasé</i> faces of men, and
limbs like thread-paper.  Fine stuff for soldiers there!"
</p>

<p>
"That's a detachment of the Crutch and Toothpick
Brigade," laughs Trentermain; "also a new importation
of society since we bade farewell to Albion's shores.
British youth don't seem to have much backbone, eh?"
</p>

<p>
They laugh and rise and go out, to the intense disgust
of a bevy of fair ones who have been directing Parthian
glances at the two magnificent-looking men in the stalls,
and drawing comparisons between them and the "Brigade"
in no way complimentary to the latter.
</p>

<p>
Once free of the theatre, they hail a hansom and are
driven to the rooms of Valentine Vane, an old comrade of
their own who has retired from the service, and is
cultivating artistic tastes with praiseworthy assiduity.
</p>

<p>
But Valentine Vane, or V.V., as his friends call him,
is in a state of pleasant excitement.  He has been invited
to a reception at the house of one of the most famous
leaders of the new school, and he insists upon carrying
the two officers off with him despite their remonstrances.
</p>

<p>
"She bade me bring any friend I pleased," he says
enthusiastically.  "Ah, when you see her!  Such grace,
such languor, such divine indolence!  Every attitude a
poem; every look a revelation of subtle meaning!  Ah!"
</p>

<p>
"Sounds serpentine, I think," says Carlisle, <i>sotto voce</i>.
"Gives you the impression of a snake gliding about.
Can't say I appreciate the prospect."
</p>

<p>
"Of course you are as yet Philistines," continues V.V.,
pouring some scent over his handkerchief as he speaks,
and gently waving the delicate cambric to disperse the
fragrance.  "Ah, you have much to learn!"
</p>

<p>
"My dear fellow," says Carlisle good-humouredly,
"do shut up that nonsense, and talk rationally."
</p>

<p>
"Rational?" echoes Vane, in surprise.  "Am I not
that?  What is there irrational in finding delight in all
that is beautiful, in wishing to be surrounded by sweet
sounds and fair objects, in striving to revive the glories
of the Hellenic age in worshipping Art as the glorious
and ennobling thing it is?"
</p>

<p>
"I am not going to say anything against art," answers
Colonel Carlisle; "but I don't think there is anything
of the Greek type about Englishmen, either physically
or intellectually, leaving out of the question the
depressing influences of climate."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" sighs Vane pityingly.  "It is all new and
strange to you.  Æstheticism, as interpreted by modern
hierophants, is, of course, essentially different from the
Hellenic school; but its aim and object is the same&mdash;to
beautify the common things of life, to ennoble the
soul, as well as please the eye and elevate the senses."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I am not sufficiently up in the subject to understand
or argue about it," laughed the Colonel.  "Perhaps
after to-night&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, yes!  Wait till you see <i>her</i>!" cries Vane
enthusiastically.  "She who has converts by the hundred,
whose intellect is as beautiful as the body which
is its temple; to whom not only the worship but the
perception of art is a natural and exquisite impulse;
whose grace, whose mind, whose movements&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, for Heaven's sake spare me any more 'serpentine'
descriptions!" entreats Carlisle.  "I am quite
ready to believe in this wonderful high priestess of yours.
Is she anything like Ellen Terry?"
</p>

<p>
"Ellen Terry is sublime also," says Vane rebukingly.
"There's not another actress on the stage could walk
in those clinging draperies of hers.  Is she not a poem?"
</p>

<p>
"She <i>acted</i> one," says the Colonel dryly.  "I saw
her in 'The Cup.'  I am not educated up to the
appreciation of subtleties yet."
</p>

<p>
"I have met at least a dozen fair-haired girls who have
all told me they were considered 'so like Ellen Terry,'"
puts in Trentermain.  "I began to think she must be a
'priestess' also."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, there are a good many changes since I was in
London last," says the Colonel.  "But there, I see you
are impatient to be off.  You&mdash;you don't mean to say
you are going to wear <i>that</i> flower, Vane?"
</p>

<p>
He points to a gardenia in his button-hole as he speaks.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; why not?" demands his friend in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  I thought the sunflower or the lily was only
admissible," says Carlisle gravely.  "I was going to ask
if it would be possible to procure one each for Trent
and myself before entering the Temple of Art and
æstheticism."
</p>

<p>
It is simply out of idle curiosity that Carlisle has
accompanied Vane and Trentermain.  He expects to be
terribly bored; but when they alight at the famous
house in Kensington, and everywhere he sees the delicate
subdued hues, the softly-shaded lights, the gracefully-arranged
ferns and shrubs and hot-house blossoms, the
artistic yet suitable dresses of the attendants, who move
about so unobtrusively (there is not a man-servant
anywhere), the strange hush and quietude, broken by no
loud voices or discordant laughter, he begins to think the
new school is not so bad after all.
</p>

<p>
"And now for the priestess," he says in a whisper to
Trent, as they follow their friend from the tea-room,
which is simply a gem.  His tall figure passes through the
curtained doorway.  A light like moonlight fills all the
room into which he enters.  His head towers above
Vane's, and straight before him he sees a woman with a
halo of golden hair loose about her brow, with a soft,
languid, serious smile, with&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Their eyes meet.  After thirteen long years of absence
and separation, Cyril Carlisle finds himself once again in
the presence of the only woman he has ever really loved.
</p>

<p>
"Colonel Carlisle, Lady Etwynde Fitz-Herbert."
</p>

<p>
He bends over her hand as she gives it.  In that
moment she is calmer, more self-possessed than himself.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I hope&mdash;I beg," he stammers confusedly.  "I
mean, I had no idea when Vane asked me to come here
that I should find myself in <i>your</i> house."
</p>

<p>
"You are very welcome," she says, and the low, tender
music of her voice thrills him with an exquisite pain.
"I&mdash;I saw your regiment had returned.  You have been
away a great many years."
</p>

<p>
"A great many," he answers, his eyes sweeping over
the lovely face and figure of the queenly woman, who is
so like and yet so different to the radiant, happy girl he
had left.
</p>

<p>
"You&mdash;you are very little altered," she says presently,
and the great fan of peacock's feathers in her hand
trembles as she meets his glance.
</p>

<p>
"Am I?" he says bitterly.  "I should have thought
the reverse; I feel changed enough, Heaven knows."
</p>

<p>
She is silent.  Her heart is beating fast, the colour
comes and goes in her face.  She is thinking how glad
she is she did not put on that terra-cotta gown with its
huge puffs and frills, but discarded it at the last moment
for this soft creamy robe of Indian silk, that seems to
float about her like a mist, and show all the lovely curves
of her perfect figure as she moves or stands.  Cyril
Carlisle thinks her more lovely than ever.  The old pain
so long buried and fought against comes back all too
vividly.  He knows he has never forgotten, never ceased
to love this woman; but she&mdash;how calm, how changed
she is!  Again, as in the past, comes back the thought
of all his love for her had meant, of all they might have
been but for his own folly, his own sin.
</p>

<p>
"A man's passions are ever their own Nemesis," he
thinks wearily, and then her voice falls on his ear again.
She is introducing him to some one.  A limp and lack-lustre
"damosel," as she loves to be called, attired in pale
sage-green that makes him bilious to contemplate; and
he is fain to give this maiden his arm, and conduct her
through the rooms, and listen to her monotonous tattle
of art jargon, which seems to him the most idiotic compound
of nonsense and ignorance ever filtered through the
lips of a woman&mdash;and he has heard a good deal.
</p>

<p>
His thoughts will go back to this strange meeting.
</p>

<p>
She is not married, she is free still.  Was it faithfulness
to him, or&mdash;&mdash;  He thrusts the thought aside
contemptuously.  What folly it seems!  What woman <i>could</i>
remember for thirteen years?  Besides, had they not
parted in anger?  Had she not cast him aside with
contempt and fierce scorn, and bitter words that had
stabbed him to the heart?
</p>

<p>
He roams about the beautiful rooms.  He hears her
name on every tongue.  He knows that men of science
and learning are here&mdash;men of note in the highest circles
of art and literature.  He is glad that her tastes are so
pure and elevated, glad that he does not find her a mere
woman of fashion, a frivolous nonentity.  Again and
again he finds himself watching that fair, serene face, that
exquisite figure, which is a living embodiment of grace
that may well drive all women desperate with envy.
</p>

<p>
How calm she is!  How passionless, how changed!
Men speak of her beauty, the beauty that lends itself so
perfectly to this fantastic fashion of which all her guests
seem devotees, and the words turn his blood to fire.  Yet,
after all, why should he mind?  She is nothing to
him&mdash;nothing.  He is beside her again.  She does not appear to
notice his presence, but she is well enough aware of it.
It lends warmth and colour and animation to her face, it
lights her great grey eyes, and brings smiles to her lips.
His heart grows bitter within him.  She must have long
ago grown callous and forgotten.  Does she really forget
how passionately she loved him once!  Does she think
of him no more than if he were the veriest stranger in her
crowded rooms?  Has she ever wept, prayed, suffered
for him?
</p>

<p>
God help us, men and women both, if we could not in
some way mask our faces and conceal our feelings!
Because the world sees no tears in our eyes it does not
follow they are never shed; because there are smiles on
our lips it is not a necessity that our hearts are without
suffering.  When the curtain is down, when the theatre
is empty and dark, then, perhaps, the real play begins;
the play that no audience sees, that is only acted out to
our own breaking, beating hearts, unsuspected and
unknown to the world around!

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI
</h3>

<p>
The crowd has lessened; the rooms are thinning now.
A great actor stands up to give a recitation.  He selects
one of Browning's poems.  Lady Etwynde, having heard
it often before, withdraws into one of the smaller rooms,
a dainty little place, with the exquisite colouring and
artistic finish of a cameo, and with only that sort of
moonlight haze shed about it that she loves so much
better than the garish brilliancy of gas, or candles.
</p>

<p>
To this retreat saunters also the figure, on whose tall
magnificent proportions even the eyes of the feminine
æsthetes have rested with an admiration contrary to all
the tenets of their school.
</p>

<p>
He seats himself beside Lady Etwynde.
</p>

<p>
"What a charming retreat," he says softly.  "Do
you know I wish you would give me a little information
about this 'æstheticism,' of which you seem a high
priestess?  I confess I feel quite bewildered."
</p>

<p>
She smiles.  She does not look up.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I suppose it is new to you," she answers.  "The
worst of it is that, like all new doctrines, it is being ruined
by exaggeration.  Genuine æstheticism is, as of course
you know, the science of beauty, and its true perception
and pursuit.  Our school has its canons, its doctrines, its
schemes and projects, on which oceans of ridicule have
been poured and yet left it unharmed.  It has done
much good; it has taught the poetry of colour and
arrangement to a class whose dress and abodes were
simply appalling to people of taste.  If you have ever
suffered from the gilded abominations of a millionaire's
drawing-room&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Colonel Carlisle moves a little impatiently.
</p>

<p>
"But is this craze to regulate our lives, to be the great
'all' of our existence?  Are men and women to go
about long-haired, straight-gowned, tousled; jabbering
'intense' nonsense and gushing over blue china and
sunflowers; and is such an existence considered elevating,
manly, or useful?  To me it seems as if I were looking
on at a pantomime."
</p>

<p>
"You are not educated yet," says Lady Etwynde,
with a demure smile.  "Everything new has, of course,
its opponents.  You have read Plato?"
</p>

<p>
"When I was at school," answers the Colonel.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" sighs Lady Etwynde.  "And you have
forgotten all he says about artistic excellence and beauty;
the relations of all physical and moral and intellectual
life to what is most perfect and intelligent; how life
should be filled with grace and dignity, the mind cultured
to its utmost capability, the body beautified by vital
activity and ennobled by a healthy and carefully taught
appreciation of all that is conducive to physical and
mental perfection."
</p>

<p>
"Has it taken you thirteen years to learn all this?"
asks Colonel Carlisle softly, as he leans forward and looks
into her eyes in the silver haze of the lamplight.
</p>

<p>
She starts a little.
</p>

<p>
"You think I am so&mdash;changed?" she says, in her
natural voice, and discarding æsthetic languor.
</p>

<p>
"I think you are ten thousand times more beautiful,
more captivating, than when I knew you first.
But&mdash;changed?  Well, yes.  Is your life devoted only to
the study of the Beautiful now?"
</p>

<p>
She colours softly.
</p>

<p>
"I think you do not quite understand," she says.
"When a woman's life is empty, something she must do
to fill up the void.  And I do not think this pursuit is so
very foolish as you seem to suppose."
</p>

<p>
"Only that John Bull has not much of the Hellenic
type about him," says the Colonel, <i>sotto voce</i>.
</p>

<p>
"You see," she goes on, with sweet gravity, "moral
beauty and physical beauty have each their worshippers.
We would weld the two together, and so glorify art,
literature, mind, physique&mdash;all that is about and around
our daily lives.  But, as I said before, like all new creeds,
it is spoiled by the over-zealous, exaggerated by the
foolish, ridiculed by the surface judges.  It is not the
cultivation of one thing only, but the cultivation of all
that real æsthetics would teach; leading, subduing,
elevating the spiritual and poetic capacity of our nature,
and subordinating the crude and material."
</p>

<p>
"That sounds more sensible," says Colonel Carlisle.
"But when I heard in your rooms of symphonies of
colour, and 'tones' of harmony, and worship of some
special make of china, and 'living up' to peacocks' fans
and feathers, I confess I thought the people were all
lunatics, to say the least of it, and marvelled how you
could have shared in such a lamentable creed and become
a priestess of 'High Art,' as interpreted by terra-cotta
gowns, sage-green furniture, and old china which
seems to convert modern drawing-rooms into a memory
of kitchen dressers.  Life may be full of emotions and
'thrills,' as I heard a long-haired youth explaining in a
dying voice, but such life as this seemed to me, I must
confess, a series of absurdities such as no sensible mind
could entertain."
</p>

<p>
"Those are the zealots and the exaggerators," smiles
Lady Etwynde amusedly.  "They have spoilt much by
carrying into extremes what is only tolerable in
moderation; by dragging in without warning what really
requires delicate and gradual preparation."
</p>

<p>
"I am glad that you are only moderate then," says
her companion.  "Some one once said that there was a
sphinx in our souls who was perpetually asking us
riddles.  I confess I thought there was one in mine when
I met you to-night under such changed auspices."
</p>

<p>
"And what was the riddle?" asks Lady Etwynde.
</p>

<p>
He bends a little closer.  "The <i>reason</i>, of course!
You told me a few moments ago that when a woman's
life was empty she must do something to fill up the void.
Was yours so empty?"
</p>

<p>
It is a bold question; he wonders he has dared ask it.
She turns pale with&mdash;anger.  Of course it is anger,
and her eyes are flashing under their long lashes, and
words won't come because her heart is hot and indignant.
So he interprets her silence and murmurs apologetically:
"Forgive me; I had no right to make such a remark;
only, I have been such a miserable man since you sent
me from your side, that it seemed in some way to console
me that you had not been quite&mdash;happy, either."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose no one is that," she says, with a suspicious
tremor in her voice.  "Something, or some one, is sure to
spoil our lives for us."
</p>

<p>
He draws back.  The shaft has hit home.  He remembers
only too well who has spoilt the life of this woman
beside him.
</p>

<p>
"Society is too artificial to content me," she goes on
rapidly.  "I want something more than amusement.  I
like to think.  I like rational conversation.  I like art,
little as I can study or understand its great teachings.  I
like all that elevates the mind, and is beautiful to the
senses; so I plunged headlong into the new school, and
it has interested and occupied me.  Do not suppose I
consider it perfect by any means; but it has done
much good&mdash;it will do more.  If you were interested
in such things you might remember the glaring colours,
the brilliant hues that made one's eyes ache not so very
long ago.  Look what lovely shades and tints we have
now.  Women required to be educated to some sense
of colour and fitness.  However plain or insignificant we
may be, we may at least make our defects less oppressive
by taste and culture."
</p>

<p>
"There I quite agree with you," says Colonel Carlisle,
wondering a little how she manages always to evade
personal topics and glide back to the keynote of their
conversation.  "But you lack neither taste nor culture;
your words apply to quite a different class of persons.
And if æsthetics teach taste and appreciation of all that
is beautiful and cultured, why, in Heaven's name, do
these people make such guys of themselves?"
</p>

<p>
"I have told you twice already that every creed has its
exaggerators."
</p>

<p>
"This creed seems to have more than its share then,"
he says amusedly.  "Your rooms are perfection, I
allow&mdash;your toilette is like a Greek poet's dream; but I
confess I see no other like it."
</p>

<p>
"You are very kind to say so," she murmurs, with an
inward congratulation that fate had saved her from the
terra-cotta gown which, in a fit of "exaggeration," she
had ordered.  "But I wanted to ask you about yourself.
Our conversation seems very one-sided.  Have you
returned to England for good?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," he says, somewhat embarrassed.
"It will depend on one or two things.  I don't know if I
am quite fit for civilized life again.  It seems to want the
air, the freedom, the unconventionally, the long nights
spent under no roof but heaven's, the excitement of sport
that may mean death at any moment, the thrill of danger,
the hazard of battle&mdash;thirteen years of such a life make
one rather impatient of your effeminate doctrines, don't
you think?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she says, with a little soft thrill at her heart
at the ring of the manly voice, at the look in the dark,
fearless eyes; "I suppose it does.  But there is no need
for you to follow the creed.  I was only explaining."
</p>

<p>
"And I don't seem to have heard half enough about
it," he answers seriously.  "What, are you going?"
</p>

<p>
"I must," she says, rising from her seat.  "The
recitation is over.  What a pity you did not listen.
Don't you like Browning?"
</p>

<p>
"I might if I could understand him," says the Colonel,
rising also and looking somewhat disturbed at the
interruption to their conversation.  "I always sympathize
with that unfortunate man in 'The Golden Butterfly';
do you remember?  The American who sits up all night
to study Browning's works because he expects him to
dinner."
</p>

<p>
Lady Etwynde laughs.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, poor fellow, and he set himself such an easy
task.  He meant to read through the <i>whole</i> collection in
the course of one evening.  Though Americans pride
themselves on doing 'big things,' I fancy that was rather
beyond him.  By the way, do you like Americans?  I
will introduce you to a charming girl if you do, and she
is not one of the æsthetic school, so you needn't be
alarmed that she will afflict you with 'art jargon.'"
</p>

<p>
"I shall be very happy," murmured the Colonel,
"only, really&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no excuses," says Lady Etwynde.  "There she
is, that pretty girl opposite.  You mustn't make love to
her, though, for she is engaged.  Her <i>fiancé</i> is not here
to-night.  That is her aunt beside her; she is quite a
character in her way."
</p>

<p>
Colonel Carlisle feels no ambition to be introduced
either to the "beauty" or the character, but he does not
like to say so, and he is soon bowing before the radiant
little figure of "Dresden China."  She looks at him with
undisguised admiration.  The "big man" has attracted
the attention of most feminine eyes to-night&mdash;all the
more perhaps because he looks so indifferent, so bored, so
unadmiring.
</p>

<p>
Pretty and bewitching as "Dresden China" is,
the Colonel seems to feel no inclination to pay her
compliments.  He stands and listens to her chatter with the
sort of amused indulgence he would bestow on any pretty
girl.  He thinks what a pity the American twang is so
strong, and how vulgar is the aunt, and marvels what the
<i>fiancé</i> is like, and why he is not now beside his lady-love.
And all the time he cannot keep his restless glance from
following the floating movements of that graceful figure
in her creamy draperies of Indian silk.  His heart echoes
the poet's words unconsciously:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  There is none like her&mdash;none!<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"What would I not give to know if she remembers
still?" he says to himself.  "But I am a fool to imagine
it possible.  Why should she? and how could she forgive
the old sin now any more than in her young, passionate,
romantic girlhood?  And yet&mdash;oh, my darling, if
life has taught you wisdom, you must surely know that
love has nothing to do with the soulless follies in which
men find beguilement, nor is there one thing on earth
they loathe so utterly as an unworthy passion, whose
pursuit has been base, whose conquest wearied almost
as soon as achieved, whose every memory is a sting that
shames them, and from which their better nature recoils
even in thought, once the evil glamour is over."
</p>

<p>
But he did not know&mdash;how should he?&mdash;that it is
just of that evil glamour a woman's heart is jealous.
</p>

<p>
When Lady Etwynde had loved him, she had been
almost a child&mdash;young, fresh, innocent, pure.  She had
abandoned herself to that love without thought or
analysis.  She had worshipped him as the noblest, truest
of God's creatures; she had thought that to him she
was all in all.  No cloud had crossed the sky, no sound
disturbed the illusion; in its innocence and depth and
peace, her love had been in its way as perfect as it was
beautiful; and then suddenly, without warning or
preparation of any sort, she had learnt that she was
deceived.
</p>

<p>
Had she known more of the world, had she been in any
way less innocent of mind and thought, she would have
known better than to expect so much as she had expected.
She would have learnt the lesson all women have to
learn, that their love must accept the evil of a man's past
as well as the good of his future, giving a simple fidelity
that asks no questions, and takes just what&mdash;remains.
</p>

<p>
But she had not known.  Her dreams had been rudely
broken; her faith as rudely shaken.  Angered, outraged,
shamed, she had been stung to the fierceness of jealous
anger, and her love had looked debased in her sight as in
his own, because of the falsehoods told and credited.
</p>

<p>
How could she judge of the emptiness and weariness
of a dead passion that he had only longed to forget, that
he dared not breathe to her pure young ears?  How
should she reck of the soulless bondage from which he
thought himself free?  She had been so proud, that his
excuses looked paltry to himself&mdash;an amorous infidelity
that this great, pure, trusting love had shamed and
shown as the debasing, selfish thing it was.
</p>

<p>
And she would hear nothing&mdash;nothing; and in his
heart he could not blame her.
</p>

<p>
"If she had loved me less she would have forgiven,"
he had said to himself.
</p>

<p>
"The innocence of youth is cruel, because its ideals are
so lofty, its exactions so great.  She thought me a hero,
and now I look only a beast!"
</p>

<p>
And he had left her.  She would never forgive, he
felt sure; and all his pleas and excuses only humiliated
him, and never touched her.  Desperate, maddened,
hating himself and his old folly, whose burden he could
never in life shake off, so he had passed from her
presence and her knowledge for thirteen long years.  And
now he stood before her again and thought of the past.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Do tell, Colonel," says the shrill voice of the Dresden
China figure beside him.  "Did you ever shoot a tiger out
there in India, and is it really so hot, and do the elephants
come out at night and knock all the houses down, and is
there nothing but curry and rice to eat, and are the ladies
all yellow, and have you brought any 'punkahs' or
tigers' claws home with you, and did you know Captain
Dasher of the 40th?  He went out to Burmah last year."
</p>

<p>
Colonel Carlisle rouses himself, and looks at her
bewildered.  He does not know how to begin answering
her questions.  Fortunately he is saved the trouble.
</p>

<p>
"Why, aunt, there's Keith!" she exclaims suddenly.
"He's come after all.  Excuse me, Colonel; that's the
young man I'm going to marry.  Will you tell him I'm
sitting here, and he's to come right along at once?"
</p>

<p>
Colonel Carlisle bows, and retreats delighted.

CHAPTER XXII
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  To feel the arms of my true love<br>
  Round me once again!<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
No one has been more astonished at the news of Keith
Athelstone's engagement than Lady Etwynde.  It comes
to her in a letter from Lauraine&mdash;a cold and strangely
written letter, yet one which has caused the writer
terrible pangs.
</p>

<p>
When they left Baden they had gone to Falcon's
Chase, and entertained a large house party there.  After
Christmas Lauraine was coming to London.  She was
not strong, and the cold, bleak air of the north tried her
severely.  All this Lady Etwynde learnt by letters&mdash;letters
that seemed curt and constrained&mdash;that in no
way revealed anything of that inner life, those secret
springs of feelings which she had learned to read and
gauge in the confidences of that past summer.
</p>

<p>
She is sitting alone in her room that is like a cameo in
the soft November dusk of the closing day.  It is some
three days since her reception and the meeting with
Colonel Carlisle.  She is thinking she will write and tell
Lauraine about it, and then again she thinks she had
better not.  In this state of indecision she is disturbed
by the entrance of one of the æsthetically-clad damsels
of her household.
</p>

<p>
"Do you receive, my lady?" she asks, presenting
her with a card.
</p>

<p>
Lady Etwynde glances at it, then blushes hotly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she says, turning away so that her tell-tale
face may not be noticed.  She feels half ashamed, half
glad.  The name on the card is "Colonel Carlisle."
</p>

<p>
She is dressed to-day in olive-green velvet, with touches
of old yellow lace about the throat and wrists;
the golden hair is coiled loosely about her beautifully
shaped head, and waves in softly tangled curls and
ripples above her brow.  She looks very lovely, and her
visitor's eyes tell her so as he bows over her slender
white hand, and murmurs conventional greeting.
</p>

<p>
"I am glad to find you at home," he says.
</p>

<p>
"It is not my day," she answers, smiling up at the tall
figure.  "But perhaps you won't object to that.  You
would have found a crowd here had it been."
</p>

<p>
"An æsthetic crowd, of course?"
</p>

<p>
"Chiefly; but I have other society as well."
</p>

<p>
"And do you live here quite alone?" he asks curiously.
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean without a sheep-dog?  Oh, yes.
Although I don't go in for advanced thought, I fail to
see why an unmarried woman can't live by herself
instead of being bored with a companion."
</p>

<p>
"And don't you find it lonely?"
</p>

<p>
"I never have time," she answers tranquilly.  "My
days are always fully occupied."
</p>

<p>
"And you are quite happy and&mdash;content?"
</p>

<p>
"As much as any one can be, I suppose," she says, a
faint colour coming into the proud, delicate face.  "I
think if one has occupation and interest one can never
be quite unhappy."
</p>

<p>
"And&mdash;affection?" he questions softly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that, of course, one does not expect," she says
hurriedly.  "I think a placid life is, after all, the best.
It is like monotones in colour&mdash;safe, restful, even it
somewhat dull."
</p>

<p>
"It sounds rather cheerless," says Colonel Carlisle
gravely.  "Art cannot satisfy our emotional faculties, or
fill our hearts as human love and sympathy can."
</p>

<p>
"Tennyson says, 'The feelings are dangerous guides,'"
she answers bitterly; "and emotion is apt to make us
capricious.  As to sympathy, well, I don't think I have
outlived that&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But love, you have?" he interrupts softly.
</p>

<p>
Her eyes meet his in startled confusion.  All their
ordinary calm is swept away.
</p>

<p>
"Have you any right to ask such a question?" she
says coldly.
</p>

<p>
His face changes.  A storm of feeling sweeps over his
soul, and for a moment chains back the impetuous words
he fain would utter.
</p>

<p>
"No; I have not&mdash;unless a long, faithful memory
of&mdash;you gives me any right."
</p>

<p>
His voice is very low, his face pale, despite the bronzing
of Indian suns.  His eyes rest on her with a great sadness
and a great longing in their depths.  She is so much
to him&mdash;this woman sitting there, with the dying daylight
on her rich-hued dress, and the fire-gleams playing
over the drooped golden head.  So much, and he&mdash;&mdash;  Oh,
fool that he has been to lose her!
</p>

<p>
"I thought men's memories were never faithful," she
murmurs, in answer to his last words.
</p>

<p>
"I know you judge them very harshly," he answers
coldly.  "I only trust that the effeminate, long-haired
apostles of your new school may prove more virtuous, if
less manly, than the old type."
</p>

<p>
She half smiles.
</p>

<p>
"Physical strength is always impatient of anything
weak or imperfect.  A man like yourself dwarfs most of
our modern youth into insignificance.  But there are
noble souls sometimes in the feeblest bodies, just as&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," he says, as she hesitates; "I can quite
follow your meaning, and accept it."
</p>

<p>
She flushes hotly.  "Pray do not misunderstand me,"
she says hurriedly.  "Do not suppose&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no," he answers, gazing back into her uplifted
eyes with the ardour of past years kindling in his own.
"I don't think I ever did <i>that</i>.  It was you who
misunderstood <i>me</i>."
</p>

<p>
"I thought&mdash;I hoped you might have forgotten," she
says, in confusion.
</p>

<p>
"It is strange that I have not," he answers.
"Thirteen years of such a life as mine ought to have
knocked sentiment pretty well out of one.  But somehow
it is not easy to forget what pains one most.  Joys
may be soon crowded out of mind and memory; sorrows
cling to us despite ourselves."
</p>

<p>
She is silent.  His words fill her with a strange trouble.
The past comes back again, and she sees her girlhood's
hero&mdash;a hero no longer, but a man, erring, sinful, faulty,
as all men and women are and will be in this troubled
world.  And yet now she feels she understands him
better than she did in those days when she had idealized
him into something grander, nobler, greater than it lay
in any man's power to be.
</p>

<p>
"When I left you," he resumes presently, gaining
courage to speak on in the silence of the gathering dusk,
"I left all the best part of my life.  You were very hard
on me, but I will not say that I did not deserve it.  Still,
your conduct did not drive me desperate, did not make
me reckless, but rather filled me with shame and sorrow
to think of how far I had fallen short of your worth, your
love&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh hush," she interrupts.  "Do you think I am
so poor and contemptible that I can listen to your words
and not feel the sting of my own vanity, my childish
ignorance, and stubborn pride?  Why, I have never
thought of my words that day without bitter shame;
and you&mdash;you were too generous even to reproach me."
</p>

<p>
"I had no right to do that," he says, very gently.
"I acted for the best, as I thought; I wished to spare
you.  You misunderstood me; that was all."
</p>

<p>
"And all these years you have&mdash;remembered me?"
she says, faintly, shyly, not daring to lift her eyes to the
grave, noble face.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he says simply.  "There is nothing so wonderful
in that.  You were the real love of my life, though
you would not believe it."
</p>

<p>
Her heart throbs quickly; the colour comes and goes
in her face.  She is silent for very joy, for very shame.
She feels so unworthy of this great, true, steadfast love,
that she so scorned once, that she had flung back at his
feet in the bygone years because another had shared, or
seemed to share it, before herself.
</p>

<p>
"You are not offended, I hope?" he says presently.
He cannot see the tears that shine on her lashes; he
only knows she is very quiet and calm, and fears that
his words were too bold.
</p>

<p>
"No.  Why should I be?" she says tremulously.
</p>

<p>
"You did not believe in me then," he goes on.  "Not
that I blame you, or indeed have ever blamed you.
When a man loves a woman as I loved you, he loves her
with not only admiration for her beauty, but reverence
for the richer possibilities of the nature into which he has
gained an insight.  I knew you were proud, and pure,
and true, and I knew that in all my life I should think of
no other woman as I had thought of you.  I was right,
you see."
</p>

<p>
Again she was silent.  Her heart beats so fast, its
quick throbs almost frighten her, what does he mean!
Can it be&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
His voice breaks across the tumult of her thoughts.
</p>

<p>
"You said once you would never forgive me," he says
softly.  "I should not like you to know how those words
troubled me: how again and again they would ring in
my ears in some scene of danger, at some moment when
Death and I have nearly shaken hands.  At such times
it seemed to me impossible that I would ever again be
in your presence, or voluntarily seek it.  Yet, strange
to say, I have done both.  Fate led me to you when I
knew nothing of where I was going, and I find myself
wondering if Time has softened your memory of the
wrong I did you once, if ever you could find it in your
heart to say the words I prayed for then, 'I forgive.'"
</p>

<p>
The tears spring to her eyes.  The old remembered
music of his voice seems to thrill her with joy and pain.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think me so hard, so cold?" she falters.
"Long, long ago, I have forgiven!"
</p>

<p>
"And you knew I was&mdash;free?"
</p>

<p>
The warm colour sweeps over her face.  Her eyes are
hidden from his eager gaze.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she says softly.
</p>

<p>
"And the past, is it all over?" he says, very low, as
he leaves his chair and bends towards her.  "Do you
still think I willingly deceived you?"
</p>

<p>
"It would have been kinder, wiser, had you told me
the truth at first," she says somewhat faintly.
</p>

<p>
In the darkness of that shadowy room, with the sense
of his presence, with the rich music of his voice thrilling
her heart with the long-vanished gladness of other days,
she feels strangely, unutterably happy.  It makes her
almost afraid.
</p>

<p>
"One thing more," he says, and he kneels at her feet
and draws her hands within his own.  "Have art and the
world and the silence of long years driven me out of your
heart, for neither danger nor absence have driven you
out of mine?"
</p>

<p>
"I told you I had not forgotten," she says, trembling
greatly and growing very pale beneath this strange
tumult of feeling that is so full of gladness and yet of fear.
</p>

<p>
"Forgotten&mdash;but that is not all.  Do you remember
the hard things you said to me when we parted?  I
kept back the error of my life, not because I wished to
deceive you, but because I feared the truth would
hurt you, and I dreaded to wound your purity and belief.
Heaven knows I had suffered then, and have suffered
since, enough to atone for a far greater mistake!  Were I
to come to you now with love as great and memory as
faithful, would you, knowing what is in the past, be
gentler with my folly?  Could you&mdash;love&mdash;me still?"
</p>

<p>
For all answer she draws her hands from his clasp, and
lays them softly round his neck, and her head sinks on
his breast.  That touch, that caress, are a new and purer
baptism of the love that has borne and suffered so much
in the years that are dead&mdash;dead as their own pain, and
laid at rest for ever now, in a grave that many tears

CHAPTER XXIII
</h3>

<p class="poem">
Tout vient à point à qui sait attendre.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"My darling Lauraine," writes Lady Etwynde, sitting
at the desk in her pretty morning room, "I am so happy&mdash;so
happy, I don't know how to find words to tell you
all about it.  <i>He</i> has come back.  Now you can guess
the rest, can you not?  For thirteen years my darling has
been true; thirteen years during which I have made no
sign, given no token of relenting.  But it is all over and
forgotten now.  Once more I seem to wake and live.  The
old, cheerless, weary years that I have dreamt away, have
lost their pain, are only full now of a soft regret that my
folly delayed my happiness; for oh! how short life
seems when one is glad, and the possibilities of the future
seem limitless.  My poor disciples are in despair, of
course.  I am bound to neglect them, for Cyril is a more
<i>exigeant</i> lover now than in those days of old.  He says
too much time has been wasted, and I cannot find
it in my heart to deny it.  We shall be married in
February, so I shall hope to have your presence.  I wish you
would come up soon.  I am longing to see you, and your
letters are so unsatisfactory.  You told me Sir Francis was
away.  Will you come and stay with me for a few weeks?
I should be more than delighted to have you, and I
am sure the change would do you good.  It seems a long
time to wait till Christmas to see you; and we might
then go down to Northumberland together.  Do make
up your mind and say 'Yes.'  You would if you knew
what pleasure it would give me."
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
This letter finds Lauraine in the lonely splendour of
Falcon's Chase.  She reads it and a little pang of
bitterness shoots through her heart.  But gradually
it subsides, and gives way to softer emotions.
</p>

<p>
"So Etwynde's pride had to give way at last," she
says to herself, folding up the letter, and half inclined
to accept its invitation.  "Ah, how great a lord is love!"
</p>

<p>
Lauraine has been almost glad of the entire peace and
quiet of the Chase since her guests have left it.  There
had been nothing but noise and excitement in it then.
The Lady Jean had come thither radiant in novelties
from Worth, and in highest spirits at the success of some
new and gigantic speculation of "Jo's," which promised
her unlimited extravagances for the season.  She had
been the life and soul of the party, had organized endless
amusements indoors and out, and had, in fact, made
herself useful to Lauraine, enchanting to Sir Francis, and
popular with every one in the house.  That infatuation
of her husband's was still unsuspected by Lauraine.
She neither noticed his devotion nor heard the
hundred-and-one comments upon it that were uttered often
enough, even in her presence.  They were old friends&mdash;had
been friends so long, it never occurred to her
that there was anything more between them.
</p>

<p>
She was not acquainted with the numerous changes
that society can ring out of the little simple air it calls
"Platonics."  She had felt grateful to Lady Jean for taking
so much trouble off her own hands, for the energy and
invention which had organized and carried out so much
that was entertaining.  It never occurred to her that
her husband might be drawing comparisons between her
and his friend, and those comparisons infinitely to the
advantage of the latter.  In accordance with her
resolution, she had set herself to work to please and study
him in every way, but now he no longer cared for either.
He rather seemed to avoid her as much as possible, and
her very gentleness and patience served to irritate him.
</p>

<p>
Her mother had been there with the rest of their guests,
and her eyes had noticed with much disquietude what
Lauraine never even seemed to see.  It made her
seriously uneasy, and in a measure irritated her against
her daughter's stupidity.  "She has lost him by her own
silliness, of course," she would say to herself.  "Just as
if a man wouldn't get bored with nothing but cold looks
and dowdiness, and all the fads and fangles that Lauraine
has occupied herself with lately."
</p>

<p>
Which was Mrs. Douglas' method of explaining
Lauraine's grief for her child's death, and her friendship
with Lady Etwynde.
</p>

<p>
It had been an intense relief to Lauraine when her
guests had all departed and she was once more alone.
</p>

<p>
She had tried hard to interest herself in things that
used to please him, to occupy her mind and thoughts;
but the efforts seemed to grow more and more wearisome.
The mind and body was at variance.
</p>

<p>
As now she sits there with Lady Etwynde's letter in her
hand, she thinks it will be better after all to go up to town
and leave this solitude, for which she had once yearned;
and when she sees in her mirror how pale and thin she
has grown she begins to think the place cannot agree
with her, as every one says.  Of course it is only&mdash;the
place.  She will not, dare not, allow that there is anything
else&mdash;that the mind is preying on itself, and trying to
outlive thought and banish memory, and that the struggle
is too hard a one.  No; that old folly is over, done with,
buried, so she tells herself.  Of Keith she has heard no
word since they met in Baden.  He may be married now,
for aught she knows, and yet somehow she feels he is
not&mdash;that.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I will go," she says, at last.  "The solitude
and dreariness are oppressing me, and Etwynde's
happiness will rouse me."
</p>

<p>
And she dashes off an immediate acceptance of the
invitation, and the next day bids her maid pack her
trunks, and starts for London.
</p>

<p>
Lady Etwynde is overjoyed to see her, but shocked
at the change in her looks.  Yet she dares not breathe
too much sympathy, or touch on the old sorrow.  "Of
what use?" she asks herself, "of what use now?"
</p>

<p>
Colonel Carlisle and Lauraine are mutually delighted
with each other.  She cannot but admire the handsome
physique, the courtly, genial manners, the cultivated
intelligence of this hero of her friend's; and they are so
perfectly content and happy with each other, that even
the most cynical disbelievers in love might acknowledge
themselves converts regarding these two.
</p>

<p>
Lauraine makes a charming "propriety."  She is
engrossed in a book, or inventive of an errand, or just
going into the other room to write a letter or try over a
song, or, in fact, furnished with any amount of excuses
that seem perfectly natural and innocent enough to leave
the lovers to themselves.
</p>

<p>
"There will be one happy marriage among my
acquaintances," she thinks to herself, as she sees them
so radiant, so engrossed.  "And, indeed, they deserve it.
Fancy, thirteen years' constancy, and in our age, too!
It seems like a veritable romance!"
</p>

<p>
One evening they go to the theatre; the piece is
Robertson's comedy, "Caste," and as Lauraine takes her
seat and glances round the well-filled house she sees in the
box opposite the well-known figures of Mrs. Bradshaw
Woollffe, and her niece, and Keith Athelstone.  Of
course, they see her directly, and exchange bows, Keith
keeps at the back of the box, and behind the radiant
little figure of his <i>fiancée</i>.
</p>

<p>
Lady Etwynde is deeply annoyed at the <i>contretemps</i>.
As for Lauraine, all the pleasure of the evening is spoilt
for her.
</p>

<p>
After the second act she sees Keith leave the box.  A
few moments afterwards he appears in their own.
</p>

<p>
"I am the bearer of a message from Mrs. Woollffe,"
he says to Lady Etwynde, after greetings have been
exchanged.  "She says I am to insist on your all coming
to supper with her.  She has secured one or two
professional and literary celebrities, and it will be very
charming.  She won't take no.  There, I have delivered
my message verbatim."
</p>

<p>
He speaks hurriedly, and a little nervously.  Colonel
Carlisle looks at his "ladye love," and declares he is
quite ready to accept if she is.  Lady Etwynde, seeing
how calm and indifferent Lauraine appears, is at a loss
what to say.
</p>

<p>
"We, I mean Lady Vavasour and I, were&mdash;&mdash;" she
stammers.  Lauraine looks quickly up&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I should be delighted to meet such charming society,"
she says.  "I am quite ready to waive our previous
engagement if you are, Etwynde."
</p>

<p>
So there remains nothing but to accept, and Keith
retires to inform Mrs. Woollffe of the success of his
mission.
</p>

<p>
"You are sure you do not mind?" asks Lady Etwynde
kindly, as she bends forward to her friend, when they
are alone.
</p>

<p>
"Not in the least&mdash;why should I?" answers Lauraine.
"And I always like Mrs. Woollffe.  I should be sorry to
offend her, and we have no excuse to offer."
</p>

<p>
"And you never tell 'white lies,'" smiles Lady
Etwynde.  "Isn't she wonderful, Cyril?"
</p>

<p>
"Lady Vavasour is indeed an example to most of her
sex," answers the Colonel.  "I thought they were all
addicted to that harmless little practice.  But I am
glad you have decided upon going to Mrs. Woollffe's.
I am delighted with her niece, although I have a
remembrance of being 'questioned' within an inch of my life
five minutes after my first introduction to them."
</p>

<p>
"Do you remember that evening?" asks Lady Etwynde softly.
</p>

<p>
"Do I not?" his eyes answer for him, as under cover
of the dim light he touches her hand.
</p>

<p>
She looks up and meets his glance, and smiles softly
back with perfect understanding.
</p>

<p>
Ah, no shadow of doubt or wrong will ever come between
herself and him again.  Lauraine notes that fond
glance, that swift comprehension, and her heart grows
sick and cold as she thinks of the emptiness of her own
life.  A woman never feels the want of love so much as
when she sees another in possession of what she has lost.
</p>

<p>
If beauty, wit, and intelligence can make a supper party
brilliant, Mrs. Bradshaw Woollffe should have had no
reason to complain.  None of the "celebrities" disappoint.
"Dresden China" is a host in herself, Colonel
Carlisle is delightful, Lady Etwynde radiant.  The only
silent members of the party are Keith Athelstone and
Lauraine.
</p>

<p>
A strange constraint is upon them both.  As from
time to time their eyes meet, each notes with a heavy
heart the change wrought in these few months.  On
Keith it is even more apparent.  His face is as pale as
if the hot young blood had been frozen in its currents,
and no longer could warm and colour that passionless
exterior.  The half petulant, wayward manner which
had been charming in its very youthfulness and caprice,
was now grave and chill, and had lost all its brightness
and vivacity.
</p>

<p>
"He is not happy," thinks Lauraine sadly, and she
glances at the pretty little sparkling creature opposite,
who is chattering and laughing as if she had not a care
in the world, and had certainly escaped the contamination
of her lover's gravity.
</p>

<p>
"Do you make a long stay in London?" asks Keith,
in a low voice, when the clatter of tongues and laughter
is at its height.
</p>

<p>
Lauraine looks suddenly up, and meets the blue eyes
that seem to have lost all their fire and eagerness now.
"No; only two or three weeks.  Lady Etwynde comes
back with me to Falcon's Chase for Christmas."
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I have something to ask you," he says, almost
humbly.  "I have longed to see you often&mdash;just for
one half-hour&mdash;to say this.  You know I have grown so
accustomed to take counsel with you that the old habit
clings to me still.  May I call on you to-morrow?  May
I see you alone?  Do not look so alarmed; you need
not fancy I have forgotten&mdash;Erlsbach."
</p>

<p>
"I shall be very glad to see you if you want my advice,"
says Lauraine, very coldly.  "But I can scarcely imagine
you do.  Surely, in all the momentous arrangements
before you, Miss Jefferson is the person you should
consult."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he answers quietly, "and her taste and mine
so invariably clash that I find the best thing to do is
to yield her undisputed choice.  Can you imagine me
yielding the palm of all things?  Beaten into
subjection.  A good beginning, is it not?"
</p>

<p>
Lauraine looks at him, inexpressibly pained by his
words and tone.  "She is very charming, and I daresay
will make an admirable wife," she says uneasily.
"I am sure every one admires your choice!"
</p>

<p>
"Isn't that rather a disadvantage nowadays?" says
Keith bitterly.  'The husband of the pretty
Mrs. So-and-so' is not a very dignified appellation.  You
see scores of men running after your wife, and if you
object are called a jealous fool, or 'bad style' or
something of that sort.  We certainly live in a delightful age
for&mdash;women."
</p>

<p>
"I don't think you ought to affect that cynical style
of talking," says Lauraine gravely.  "It doesn't sit
naturally on your years, and it is too much like the
caught-up cant of society.  Women are no worse now
than they have always been, I suppose, nor men either."
</p>

<p>
"It is like old times to have you 'lecturing' me,"
says Keith, with a sudden smile&mdash;the first she has seen
on his lips to-night.
</p>

<p>
Lauraine colours and remembers.  "Well, you deserve
a lecture for speaking so.  I hate to hear men, especially
young men, abusing women!  As if the worst of us were
not, after all, better than most of you.  And what do
you know, <i>really</i> know, of women?  At your age a man is
hardly conscious of what he wants except amusement
and excitement; and the woman who gives him these,
be her moral nature ever so vile, is the woman from whom
he takes his opinions of the whole sex.  '<i>Toujours
femme varie</i>' has a wide meaning.  To deduce from <i>one</i>
an opinion of all, is the greatest folly a man can commit."
</p>

<p>
"What a tirade!" says Keith amusedly.  "I know
well enough your sex are enigmas.  It is hard to make
out what you really are.  And I am quite sure that I
shall never meet another woman like you; but I hope
you don't mean to say that I have formed my opinion
from a 'bad' specimen."
</p>

<p>
"I was speaking of men in general," says Lauraine,
somewhat hurriedly.  "The fashion of talking slightingly
of women is a most pernicious one.  Certainly we
are to blame, or our age, for such a fashion.  Women
have too little dignity nowadays; but they suffer for it,
by losing their own prestige in the sight of men."
</p>

<p>
"You would never lose your self-respect," says Keith,
in a low voice.
</p>

<p>
"I should be the most miserable woman alive if I did,"
she answers composedly; but her cheeks burn, and in
her heart she says: "I have lost it&mdash;long ago!"
</p>

<p>
"Ah," says Keith bitterly, "it is well to be you.
Heaven help you if you had been cast in a weaker mould,
like those you condemn; if you had to look back on life
as only a <i>coup manque</i>."
</p>

<p>
A burst of riotous laughter drowns his words.  The
whole table is convulsed over some <i>risqué</i> American
story told with inimitable point and humour by the lovely
rosy lips of "Dresden China."
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
As they part that night Keith whispers in Lauraine's
ear: "To-morrow, twelve, I will call."

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIV
</h3>

<p>
Lauraine wakes up next morning with a vague
consciousness that she has done something wrong, something
which she regrets.  Why should she have granted this
interview to Keith Athelstone?  Why should he have
asked for it?
</p>

<p>
And yet, amidst all her disquietude, she smiles bitterly
as she thinks how far away, how "over and done with,"
is that old time between them.  She is married, he about
to be married.  There can be nothing to fear now.
</p>

<p>
During breakfast she is silent and preoccupied.  She
wonders what excuse she can make to Lady Etwynde
for breaking a shopping engagement; but, as if fate
played into her hands, Lady Etwynde tells her that
Colonel Carlisle is coming to drive her to Bond Street
that morning to choose some diamonds he has seen, and
so the dressmakers must be put off.  Lauraine seizes
the chance delightedly, and says she will stay at home
and have a quiet morning for once, and at half-past
eleven Lady Etwynde drives off in her <i>fiancé's</i> mail
phaeton, and Lauraine finds herself alone.
</p>

<p>
Her uneasiness increases.  She can settle to nothing.  A
feverish colour burns in her cheeks, her eyes are brilliant.
Every step in the street, every ring at the bell, startles
and unnerves her.  Again and again she wishes she had
not promised to see Keith.  Again and again does she
find herself hoping, praying he may not come after all.
</p>

<p>
Twelve strikes.  She is sitting in the "cameo" room&mdash;her
own special favourite&mdash;her eyes watch the hands
of the clock with an absorbed fascination.
</p>

<p>
One minute past, two, three, four, five.  He will not
come.  Ten minutes past.  Now she is quite sure he will
not.  Is she relieved, or sorry?  Eleven minutes past.
</p>

<p>
He is here.  "I am sorry to be late.  I was detained,"
he says, greeting her nervously.  "I should have liked
to keep up my old character for punctuality."
</p>

<p>
She gives him her hand.  Now that he <i>has</i> come she
feels calm and composed once more, and all her gentle
dignity of manner returns.  "And what is the momentous
business on which I am to give my opinion?" she
asks, as he takes the low seat opposite her own and looks
steadily at her.
</p>

<p>
For an instant he is silent.  Then he shakes back the
soft hair from his brow with the impatient gesture that
she well remembers.
</p>

<p>
"It is only&mdash;this," he says.  "If I go through with
this marriage it will drive me mad!"
</p>

<p>
Startled, surprised out of all her self-control, Lauraine
looks at him in dread and horror.
</p>

<p>
"Why do you come to me and tell me this?" she says
piteously.  "Of what use is it?"
</p>

<p>
"None, I suppose.  I only wanted to say I took your
advice; that with might and main I set myself to work
to care for Nan.  I might as well have saved myself the
trouble.  There are times when a devil within me rises
and tempts me to kill her: when I hate myself for
deceiving her, and her for being deceived; when&mdash;&mdash;  But
why pain your ears with such folly?  This thing is
too hard for me.  I cannot do it, Lorry&mdash;I <i>cannot</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Keith!"  It is such a sorrowful little cry.  It
is just as when in their childish days some deed or freak
of his had grieved his little playmate's gentle heart.
It thrills through him with a pain that is intolerable.
</p>

<p>
"For God's sake, don't speak like that&mdash;don't pity
me!" he cries wildly.  "It is more than I can bear.
Oh, Lorry, don't think I have come here to-day to
distress you with the old sorrow.  It is not that, indeed.  I
only wanted to say that I have brought double dishonour
on my head by trying to do what you seemed to think
would cure me; to ask you if you would have me go
through with this horrible farce&mdash;for, as there is a
Heaven above us, I would sooner die the worst death
you could name, than speak such a lie in face of God and
man as I should speak did I promise to be a husband
to&mdash;Nan."  His voice is low and husky, and the words
come out with fierce, unstudied eloquence.
</p>

<p>
Lauraine's heart aches as she listens, as she looks.
She is utterly at a loss what to say.
</p>

<p>
"I parted from you in anger.  I spoke roughly,
cruelly.  I said I would never come to you again," he
goes on, looking at her white face&mdash;his own as white and
sorrowful.  "I have longed often to ask your pardon.  I
do it now.  There is but one course open to me.  I must
leave this country.  I must leave any place that has a
memory of&mdash;you.  I think sometimes I shall go mad if I
don't.  I think you would be shocked, Lorry, if you could
look into my soul and see the utter blankness there.  I
am not old, and there is no ice in my veins yet, and
forgetfulness won't come for trying any more than&mdash;love.
Oh, if it only would&mdash;if it only would!"
</p>

<p>
For an instant a sob rises in his throat and chokes his
utterance.  He rises, ashamed of his weakness, and paces
the room with hurried, uneven steps.
</p>

<p>
"I am forgetting myself.  I did not mean to say such
things," he says presently.  "When I am with you I
can think of nothing else.  Oh, my darling! how <i>could</i>
you have given yourself away from me?  Will ever any
man love you as I have done, and do!"
</p>

<p>
Lauraine's heart is rent asunder by the fierce, unstudied
pathos of his words.  She sees that her own weakness
has wrecked two lives effectually, and now her whole
soul is filled with anguish and with dread.
</p>

<p>
"I can see at last that the only course for me to pursue
is complete avoidance of your presence," he goes on,
coming over to the mantelpiece as he speaks and leaning
his arm upon it so as to keep his face out of her sight.
"We should be all, or nothing, to each other; and I
being mad and reckless, and you good and pure, it is
easy to see which of the two is our fate."
</p>

<p>
"Good and pure!" cries Lauraine, with sudden
passionate shame; "had I been <i>that</i> I should never have
paltered with temptation one single moment.  I should
have been deaf to your entreaties and persuasions that
summer night.  I should have sent you from me then,
not weakly yielded to a course of action that has made
me as wretched as yourself."
</p>

<p>
"You could never be <i>that</i>," he says, looking down at
her anguished face.  "You are too cold, too proud.
But so much the better.  I would not wish the worst
foe I had to endure what I have endured for you, and
shall endure, I suppose, till I die.  That sounds rather
like mock heroics," he adds, with a little bitter laugh;
"but I think you know me better than to suppose it's
'put on.'  I made up my mind when I saw you that I
would tell you this farce could not go on.  I shall tell
Nan the same.  She's a good little thing, and is worth
a better fate than she would have as my wife.  God!
The mockery of that word!  At night sometimes it is as
if a chorus of fiends were jabbering it in my ears, and
driving me mad with the horrible sound."
</p>

<p>
"What will you say&mdash;how explain?" falters Lauraine.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you need not be afraid that your name will
suffer," he says, with bitterness.  "I shall take care of
that.  Let her think me the mean, contemptible cur I am."
</p>

<p>
The hot cruel colour flies into Lauraine's cheeks.
</p>

<p>
"You are ungenerous to say that!" she exclaims.  "I
am not afraid of what any one says.  I know I am to
blame.  But because I have erred once it is no reason
that I should do so again.  Right and wrong are set
plainly enough before us.  I have tried, feebly enough,
to keep to the straight path; I cannot forget duty,
honour, so easily.  If I could&mdash;if I had&mdash;oh, Keith, ask
yourself, would your love be what it is now?"
</p>

<p>
"No; it would not," he says slowly.  "Though I
am so bitter against you I would not have you shamed
by my selfishness.  I&mdash;I think&mdash;so much at least you
have taught me.  But you&mdash;understand, do you not?
I cannot do impossibilities, and&mdash;now at last, I come to
you to say 'Good-bye.'"
</p>

<p>
A sudden mist of tears dims her eyes.  It seems as if all
around grows cold and grey, and a barrier of ice stands
between her and any hope of happiness.
</p>

<p>
There is a long silence.  He still leans there, his head
on his hand, his face turned towards her as if to gaze his
last on the beauty he loves and remembers with so
absorbed and passionate a fidelity.  Her eyes, amidst
those blinding tears, meet his own longing gaze.  She
rises from her seat and holds out her hand, while her
voice, broken and full of unutterable sadness, cries out:
"Oh, Keith, what should I say&mdash;what should I do?
May God have mercy on us both."
</p>

<p>
"If you wish His mercy on <i>you</i>, don't cry," says Keith
hoarsely, "or you will make me so desperate that I shall
forfeit any little bit of kindness you may still
feel!  Be cold, cruel, scornful if you please, but don't
drive me mad with sight of your sorrow.  Mine I can
bear&mdash;it is no new friend.  But yours&mdash;&mdash;"  Lauraine dashes
the tears from her eyes, and makes a violent effort at
self-control.  "I cannot ask you to forgive me," she says;
"it would be better if you could learn to hate me.  I
wonder you do not, when you think of all the sorrow I
have brought into your life."
</p>

<p>
"I have tried my best to hate you," he says gloomily;
"I <i>cannot</i>.  Do you suppose that if, by any deed, any
power of will, I could tear your memory from my heart,
and once again know peace, that I would not do it?  God
knows how gladly!  But I cannot; I must go on thinking
of you, loving you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He ceases abruptly, then goes on:
</p>

<p>
"And once you put your arms round my neck and
told me you would be mine 'for ever.'  There are times
now when I seem to feel that soft touch and the thrill of
your unasked kiss, and&mdash;and then, Lorry, I remember
that 'for ever' meant less than&mdash;four years."
</p>

<p>
"You&mdash;you promised," falters Lauraine.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you are right.  So I did.  I seem to do nothing
but make promises and break them with you.  Well,
there is one comfort, after to-day I shall have no chance
of doing either one or other.  There can be no distance
too wide to set between our lives.  And&mdash;oh God, to
think of what might have been!"
</p>

<p>
"Life is full of mistakes," says Lauraine, weeping
unrestrainedly now.  "Oh, had I but known&mdash;had
I but known!  Yet, Keith, something tells me that
time will bring you consolation&mdash;time and the consciousness
that you have done right."
</p>

<p>
"Your words are beyond my powers of acceptance,"
he answers gloomily.  "If I am doing right now, it is
from no good motive, I assure you.  If again you said to
me 'Stay,' there would be no more parting this side the
grave, Lorry, for you and me."
</p>

<p>
His voice is very low and unsteady, but she hears every
word, and all the wild love and longing, the weariness
and emptiness of her life, seem beating like waves against
the poor weak barriers of honour.
</p>

<p>
"I think I would give all the world to be able to say
it to-day," she cries, with sudden passion.  "But, oh,
Keith! the 'to-morrow,' that would follow; the sin and
misery that would be with us both for ever!  Is life or
love worth one's eternal ruin?  Is our parting now to be
compared to that 'other' parting that would have
to follow&mdash;the eternal parting that would be so hopeless
because of the guilt that lay upon our souls?"
</p>

<p>
"I do not think a great love can ever be a sin," Keith
answers passionately.  "And mine would last you if
ever human love did last.  So much I know of myself,
bad as I am."
</p>

<p>
"You are not bad," says Lauraine gently.  "And I
am sure you won't threaten me with the worse misery of
your recklessness as once before you did.  The nobler
and better your life, the less will be my suffering.  And
you won't be cruel enough to add to that, will you?"
</p>

<p>
The pleading voice, the tearful eyes, unman him.
"Why don't you abuse me, condemn me, call me the
selfish brute I am?" he says, with that rapid contrition
that so often marks his wildest moods.  "No, Lorry, I
won't be 'bad' if I can help it.  I wouldn't wish to add
to your suffering, though I am so selfish.  Let me go
now, while I have strength, while the good fit is on
me.  It mayn't last, you know, and then&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He is standing facing her, and white as death she looks
up and meets the mournful gaze of the "bad blue
eyes."  There is no badness in them now, only a great
anguish and a great despair.  One long, long look they
give&mdash;a look that seems to read her heart, and all its love
that she denies, and all its suffering that he has given.
He takes her hands and draws her near, nearer.  She
trembles like a leaf.  Her eyelids droop, her lips quiver.
</p>

<p>
"May I&mdash;kiss you?" he whispers.
</p>

<p>
She makes no answer in words, for speech is beyond
her.  She forgets everything now, save that she loves,
and that this is an eternal farewell to her lover.
</p>

<p>
There comes such a moment of forgetfulness to all
women who love, otherwise, indeed, there would be none
to fall for love's sake only.  Otherwise, how easy would
be the conflict that, of all others is the wildest, the
fiercest, and hardest to wage.
</p>

<p>
She lifts her head.  The anguish, the entreaty in her
eyes frighten, and yet gladden him.  For in this moment
he feels he is master of her fate, and she is unconscious
of the fact.  Did he but hold her in his arms&mdash;did the
tide of passion, locked back within his throbbing heart,
find vent in one word, one caress, he knows he could not
answer for himself&mdash;for her!
</p>

<p>
It is the critical moment of Keith Athelstone's life.
All that is best and worst in his heart are at war; all
that is most hard to resist wraps him in a flame of tempting
that burns away all good resolves, and almost stifles
the faint whispers of a conscience that pleads for her.
</p>

<p>
For her&mdash;for her.  To save her from <i>herself</i> as well as
from his own mad love.  To leave her unharmed,
untainted by the baseness of his selfish passion; to be
worthy of love, as love had been in those sweet, glad,
childish days.  These thoughts flash like lightning
through his brain, even as he meets her mournful eyes,
and reads their unconscious betrayal.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, love, good-bye!  Let me go!" he cries wildly,
and throws her hands aside with almost cruel force.
</p>

<p>
He is blind and dizzy with pain.  A word, a look from
her, and he knows that his strength will be broken like
a reed&mdash;that he will never leave her again; and in his
blindness and dizziness and agony of heart he rushes
away, flings the door wide open, and finds himself face to
face with&mdash;Sir Francis Vavasour!

<h3>
CHAPTER XXV
</h3>

<p>
Fate delights in playing mankind spiteful tricks.
</p>

<p>
The present instance is no exception.  Lauraine has
sunk back into her chair, faint and spent with emotion;
scarcely conscious, indeed, of what is going on around
her; and in this state her husband's rough voice breaks
upon her ear.
</p>

<p>
"What the devil's the matter?  I met Athelstone
flying out like a bomb-shell, and you look like a ghost.
Have you been having a&mdash;fraternal quarrel?"
</p>

<p>
She starts to her feet and looks at him with wild, wide
eyes.  "Francis, you&mdash;" she gasps.
</p>

<p>
"You don't seem very pleased to see me," says her
husband, looking at her suspiciously.  "What on earth
have you been doing with yourself?  You look as ill as
possible."  He takes her hand and kisses her carelessly
on the cheek as he speaks.
</p>

<p>
"I have not been well," she falters, trying for composure,
"and Etwynde asked me to come to her for a few weeks,
and I thought the change would do me good.  How is it
you are in London?  Did you know I was here?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I got your letter at the club and came on.  I
only arrived last night."
</p>

<p>
He throws himself into a chair, and looks at her
curiously.  "What was the row with Athelstone?&mdash;you
haven't told me."  Lauraine grows very white.
</p>

<p>
"He is going abroad&mdash;away for years.  His engagement
is all over.  He came to say good-bye."
</p>

<p>
Sir Francis gives a long whistle.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Nom de Dieu</i>?  Is that so?  And have you had a
hand in breaking it off, my lady?"
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?" she asks, looking at him with
grave surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Mean?  Oh, you and Keith were such chums always.
I thought he had done it because you&mdash;objected.
I know you never liked the marriage."
</p>

<p>
"It had nothing to do with me," says Lauraine
coldly.  "And the girl was very fond of him.  I am
sorry for her."
</p>

<p>
"It strikes me that Jean wasn't so far out, after all,"
says Sir Francis, with a harsh laugh.  "You and Keith
<i>do</i> seem to have a remarkably good understanding with
each other."
</p>

<p>
Lauraine looks at him, her eyes dark with anger.
"Since when have you taken to speak so familiarly of
Lady Jean Salomans?" she asks; "and by what right
does she discuss my actions with you?"
</p>

<p>
"Come, that won't do," says her husband, throwing
himself back in his chair, and looking at her defiantly.
"It's rather too like the proverb of the pot and the
kettle.  You discuss me with Keith Athelstone, I have no
doubt, and&mdash;other things too."
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean to insult me?" asks Lauraine, rising
from her seat, and looking steadily at him.
He shrugs his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"You are always so tragic.  Insult you?  No.  Only
before you question my actions, it might be as well to
look at your own.  Are they quite&mdash;blameless?"
</p>

<p>
She stands there, and all the colour fades from her
face; her limbs tremble.  "I will not affect to
misunderstand you," she says slowly.  "But&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He interrupted her roughly.  "Don't trouble to
explain.  Of course we all know you are <i>sans reproche</i>.
Only don't turn the cold shoulder to other women, when
you yourself are no better than they&mdash;seem.  Were I a
jealous husband I should have forbidden Keith
Athelstone your presence long ere this."
</p>

<p>
"There would have been no need," she says proudly.
"I am not a woman to forget honour and self-respect."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, fine words are easy," scoffs her husband.  "To
the untempted virtue is no merit.  And although any
one could see Keith Athelstone was making himself a
fool about you, yet you never cared a straw for him.  If
you had&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Well?" she asks, very low, as he pauses.
</p>

<p>
He laughs again.  "You would have been no better
than&mdash;others, I suppose.  What you call self-respect
is only another word for cold-heartedness."
</p>

<p>
Lauraine thinks of the scene through which she has
just passed.  Cold-hearted?  Well, if she be, she thanks
God for the fact.  That her husband should speak thus
to her fills her with an intense shame.  After all, would
he have cared so very much, if&mdash;&mdash;  The evil thought
coils round her like a serpent, she feels sick and stifled,
and full of pain and fear.
</p>

<p>
"I am going to my room," she says hurriedly.  "Will
you excuse me?  I&mdash;I am not very well."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ma chére</i>," laughs her husband roughly, "one
doesn't stand on ceremony after a few years of married
life.  Don't stay here for me.  I'm off too, now.  I have
heaps of things to do."
</p>

<p>
"Will you dine with us to-night?" asks Lauraine.
</p>

<p>
"To-night?  Well, yes.  I suppose it will look
better, and I should like to see what sort of fellow your
æsthetic friend has captured.  Jove! if men only knew
what fools they are to marry!"
</p>

<p>
But Lauraine has left.  Sir Francis takes up his hat.
His face is dark and disturbed.
</p>

<p>
"Jean was right.  There is something," he mutters.
"But Lauraine is not like&mdash;her.  Should I be better
pleased if she were?  Sometimes I think I would give
the world for freedom; and yet&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The door opens.  Lady Etwynde sweeps in, as radiant
and fair a vision as eyes could wish to behold.
</p>

<p>
"Sir Francis!  You here, and alone!  Why, where is
Lauraine?"
</p>

<p>
"Gone to her room.  Not well, or tired, or something,"
he says, as he shakes hands.  "I am glad you
have had her here; she mopes herself to death down
at the Chase.  I can't see what she is so fond of it for.
I detest it myself."
</p>

<p>
"There are associations, you see," says Lady
Etwynde.  "Her child was born there, and there died."
</p>

<p>
He feels somewhat ashamed.  He thinks of his wife&mdash;how
young, how sorrowful she looked; how all the life
and radiance seemed crushed out of her heart.  But
then the old weariness and impatience assert themselves.
Life with Lauraine has been so flat and monotonous.
</p>

<p>
"Well, at all events it does not agree with her," he
says, brusquely.  "I was glad to find her in town.  I
got her letter at the club."
</p>

<p>
"Will you dine with us to-night?" asks Lady
Etwynde.  "We are quite alone, so it won't be very lively,
and you have had so much brilliant society lately."
</p>

<p>
He looks quickly at her.  He is always suspicious of
women's words; always given to looking under them for
some hidden meaning.  But Lady Etwynde's face is
innocence itself.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks.  Yes.  I told Lauraine I would come," he
says, not very cordially, for indeed an evening with
these two women looks a dreary penance to him.
</p>

<p>
"And you will stay here, will you not?" says Lady
Etwynde.  "You won't go back to an hotel while
Lauraine is in town?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I could not think of inflicting myself upon you,"
he says hurriedly: "and it is such a flying visit&mdash;thanks
all the same.  And now, good-bye till to-night."
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye," says Lady Etwynde coldly.  She
thinks his behaviour both strange and callous, and very
uncomplimentary to his wife.  Then he leaves, and she
goes to Lauraine, and finds her lying in a darkened
room, white, and spent and exhausted.
</p>

<p>
"My dear, what is it?" she asks, in alarm.  "Has
anything happened?  Are you ill?"  For a moment
Lauraine hesitates.  Then the sight of the sweet,
compassionate face melts the hardness that she fain would
keep about her heart, and in a few broken words she
relates the whole sad tale of that interview and farewell.
</p>

<p>
"My only comfort is that at last he will go&mdash;surely he
will leave me," she says, in conclusion.  "Indeed, it is
time.  The strain is more than I can bear.  Besides,
Sir Francis has noticed it&mdash;he said so; and his words
were scarce a greater insult than I deserved, for if
I have not sinned as the world counts sin, yet I have
not been guiltless&mdash;far from it."
</p>

<p>
Lady Etwynde looks at her wistfully.  In her own
great happiness she can feel tenfold the sorrowful fate of
these sundered lives.  "And he is going to break off his
marriage?" she says anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," says Lauraine.  "He says to go through with
it is beyond his power."
</p>

<p>
"Poor fellow!" exclaims Lady Etwynde, with
involuntary compassion.
</p>

<p>
She is angry with him, and yet sorry for him, for he
has proved so faithful; and, after all, is any love quite
unselfish if it be worth the name?
</p>

<p>
"My poor Lauraine!" she murmurs involuntarily.
"Your marriage has indeed been a fatal error; but, as I
have said before, there remains nothing but to make the
best of it.  The only thing for you and Keith is
separation.  All other feelings except that one forbidden one
are a poor pretence.  I feared that long ago.  I am
glad you have been so brave, and he too.  Believe me,
hard as duty is, the very effort of doing it creates
strength for further trials.  The consciousness of right is
a satisfaction in itself, even when one is misjudged."
</p>

<p>
Lauraine listens, and the tears stand on her lashes,
and roll slowly down her cheeks.
</p>

<p>
"My life is very hard," she says bitterly.
</p>

<p>
"Would it be less hard if you had ceased to respect
yourself, if you had lost the creeds and faiths which still
make honour your one anchor of safety?  I think not."
</p>

<p>
"I can think of nothing now save him and his unhappiness,"
cries Lauraine wildly.  "I have never loved
him as I love him to-day.  Oh!  I know it is wrong,
shameful to say such a thing; but it is the truth, and I must
speak it&mdash;this once.  Why, do you know that when he
said good-bye to me I could have flung myself at his
feet and said, 'Let the world go by, let sin or misery be
my portion for evermore&mdash;only do not you leave me!'  It
seemed as if nothing in life was worth anything beside
one hour of love!  And yet&mdash;well, how good an actress
I must be, Etwynde&mdash;he called me cold-hearted."
</p>

<p>
"Thank God he did!" exclaims Lady Etwynde.
"Oh, Lauraine, your good angel must have saved you
to-day.  I did not think it had come to this; and I
cannot find it in my heart to blame you, for&mdash;I love too."
</p>

<p>
"And my husband taunted me with being no better
than other women, simply because I had never been
tempted," continues Lauraine presently.  "Well,
perhaps in heart I am not.  He may have been right, and
virtue is, after all, only a matter of&mdash;temperament."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, hush!  I cannot bear to hear you talk like
that," cries Lady Etwynde.  "Does he&mdash;does Sir
Francis suspect anything?"
</p>

<p>
"He said he knew Keith loved me," answers Lauraine
wearily.  "Fancy hearing one's husband speak of the
love of another man!  I felt treacherous&mdash;shamed
in his sight and my own.  He could not understand&mdash;he
would not believe in the long, long struggle, the pain,
the suffering of it all.  I feel as if conscience and honour
had both suffered in the conflict, as if with my child I
had lost all that was pure and of any worth in me.  And
now the world may say what it likes.  I don't care even
to contradict it."
</p>

<p>
"That is not true," exclaims Lady Etwynde.
"You have struggled nobly, you have done your best,
and the fruits of the victory will be yours in time.  At
least you hold the hope of meeting your little child,
innocent and unshamed, despite fierce tempting and
all the weariness and sorrow of your life."
</p>

<p>
Lauraine's tears fall faster and more fast.
</p>

<p>
"My child!  Oh, why was he not left to me?  The
touch of his innocent kiss, the sound of his voice, the
clasp of his arms were strong as all the chains of duty
cannot be.  And now there is no one&mdash;no one.  And I
am so lonely, so desolate, and life looks so long, and
death so far away!"
</p>

<p>
The tears rush to Lady Etwynde's eyes.  "Oh, my
darling!  What can I say to comfort you?  Do you
know, Lauraine once&mdash;in years that are gone&mdash;when I
felt reckless and despairing as yourself, I left the house,
and went out full of some wild resolve too terrible to
mention.  It was a Sunday evening, I remember well.  The
bells were sounding everywhere, and I walked on
through the quiet streets with madness in my heart.
Suddenly, as I passed the open door of a church, I heard a
voice singing.  Involuntarily I stopped, listened,
entered.  It was a large church, and full of people.
Some one gave me a chair, and I sank down wearily
enough.  Then, pealing above the chords of the organ,
floating up to the great vaulted roof, I heard again the
beautiful voice, and it sang these words: 'O rest in
the Lord; wait patiently for Him, and He shall give
thee thy heart's desire.'  You know them, do you not,
and the music that weds them so exquisitely from the
'Elijah'?  I knelt there with my head bowed on my
hands, and the tears falling down my cheeks.  I
remembered nothing; neither place nor presence.  It only
seemed as if an angel's voice was breathing comfort to
my passion-wrecked soul, as if that beautiful promise fell
over my spirit and brought peace, and healing, and rest.'
'Thy heart's desire!'  Oh, Lauraine, think of that!
Twelve long years ago that message came to me, and I
was comforted!  Twelve years, and now God <i>has</i>
fulfilled His promise.  My heart's desire is mine."
</p>

<p>
Lauraine has listened, stilled and awed.
</p>

<p>
"Thy heart's desire."  The words sink into her very
soul, and wake a thousand varied emotions.
</p>

<p>
"But my 'heart's desire' is all wrong&mdash;all sin&mdash;whichever
way I look at it," she says, half despairingly.
</p>

<p>
"God can make it right," whispers Lady Etwynde
drawing the white, sad face down upon her bosom, and
softly kissing the weary lips.  "If you can take those
words home to your heart as I did, my darling, your
burden will grow easier to bear; the strength you ask
for will be given.  Oh, life is hard, terribly hard, I know!
There is so much sorrow, so little joy; and then the
errors, the sins which beset, the weakness that shackles
us!&mdash;but still, still, we are not tried <i>beyond</i> our strength,
and we may be able at last to look back and see it was all
for the best!"
</p>

<p>
"What would I not give to recall these last four
years!" cries Lauraine bitterly.  "How different my
life might have been!"
</p>

<p>
"There's no turning back," says Lady Etywnde
solemnly.  "Errors, once committed, are irrevocable;
for them we must suffer; by them we must abide.
Ah, my dear! who would not live their time again if
they might, and by the light of the present alter all the
mistakes of the past?  But it cannot be done.  All
the remorse and all the regret are so futile.  Tears of
blood cannot wash away one memory, take out the sting
of one mistake.  We must just bear life as it is, till Death
seals all its woes into forgetfulness."
</p>

<p>
"You are so good," cries Lauraine sadly.  "I am
not like you.  I am wicked and rebellious, and I cannot
accept my fate with patience, even though I know my
own past weakness is to blame for all my present misery."
</p>

<p>
"I am not good.  Do not praise me," says Lady
Etwynde humbly.  "And I know I do not deserve
my present happiness.  It makes me fearful of my great
joy.  For I was so wicked and rebellious once, and I
wonder often that God did not take my life instead of
sparing it, and blessing it as He has done.  Now, darling,
you look worn out, and must need rest.  I will leave you
for awhile.  If your husband suspects anything you
must try and banish such suspicions, or your married
life will grow yet more unhappy.  The great wrench is
over, the worst is past.  Time, and the consciousness of
having done what is right, will give you peace and
comfort at last.  Youth and strength are yours still, and
many good gifts of life, and if you throw yourself into
others' sufferings, and widen your sympathy with the
interests and trials of those around you, believe me it
will do much to making your own troubles less.  I speak
from an experience as bitter as, if less hopeless, than
your own."  And once more kissing the closed lips which
seem too weary for tears, she lays Lauraine back on the
pillows, and softly leaves the room.
</p>

<p>
"'Thy heart's desire!'" Lauraine cries to herself.
"Oh, God&mdash;not that&mdash;not that should be my prayer.
Teach my heart to say, 'Thy will, not mine!'"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVI
</h3>

<p>
When Keith Athelstone leaves Lauraine that morning
he is scarcely conscious of what he is doing.
</p>

<p>
And yet with his brain whirling, with a desperate
sense of his life's complete failure oppressing his heart,
he goes straight to his <i>fiancée's</i> house and asks to see her.
</p>

<p>
Miss Nan flies into the room, as she expresses it, "like
greased lightning."
</p>

<p>
"Well, what's the matter?" she cries.  "Has the
bank broke, or has Worth failed, or&mdash;&mdash;  Why, Keith,"
(with sudden gravity), "are you ill?"
</p>

<p>
Her voice seems to recall his senses.  He sits down
and looks sadly at the radiant little figure.
</p>

<p>
"Nan," he says brokenly, "I&mdash;I have come to say
that I have behaved to you like a cad, a brute.  I have
no excuse to offer.  I can only tell you the plain truth,
and that is&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Stop!" she cries suddenly; and all her airs and
affectations seem to fall off her, leaving only a quiet,
pale-faced little maiden, whose big, bright eyes are
clouded and sad.  "I know what you mean.  You
don't love me.  It is not what comes to me, Keith, only
I thought I might help to console you, being so fond of
you as I was, for&mdash;she&mdash;can be nothing to you after all."
</p>

<p>
"You&mdash;you know&mdash;&mdash;" stammers Keith.
</p>

<p>
"Know, of course I know," she answers, with pretty
contempt.  "Do you think I was reared in Boston and
can't see a little bit through a stone wall, specially when
that stone wall has some mighty big chinks to let the
daylight in?  Know&mdash;why, who doesn't know that's
ever seen you and 'my Lady Lauraine' together?"
</p>

<p>
The colour mounts to Keith's brow.  "And I have
done her all this harm," he thinks.  "Don't be afraid
to speak out to me," continues Nan.  "I'm too fond of
you to be cross, and I know you've tried your best to be
true to me.  We'd best forget that we ever thought of
being more than friends.  Don't you trouble to explain.
If you hadn't said this, I should have done so
before it came to the real business.  I don't want to
marry a man whose heart is set on another woman,
and you loved her before you knew me&mdash;didn't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he says quickly.  "Since we were boy and
girl together."
</p>

<p>
"And why did she jilt you?" asked Dresden China
tranquilly.  Her heart is so full, and pained, and angry,
that she is afraid of betraying herself.
</p>

<p>
"She was forced into marrying another man during
my absence," says Keith coldly.  "I was forbidden to
write, and when I trusted&mdash;well, it was her mother&mdash;to
tell her about myself&mdash;my changed fortunes&mdash;she
never did.  When I came back from New York she
was married."
</p>

<p>
"If she'd have been worth her salt she'd have kept
true to you," says Nan.  "I don't believe in girls
caving in, and marrying to please other people.  I
wouldn't, not for fifty mothers, leave alone one."
</p>

<p>
"No, you are a staunch little thing," says Keith, looking
up at the bright <i>mignonne</i> face; "and you are worth
a man's whole heart and life, Nan, and I feel I am neither
worth the offering nor the acceptance.  I have been a
fool; but at last I seem to see my folly, and I am going
to make one vigorous effort to conquer it.  I am going to
leave England&mdash;perhaps for ever."
</p>

<p>
"I think it is the very best thing you can do," she
says quietly.  "What is the use of wasting your life,
and eating your heart out for a woman who can be
nothing to you?"
</p>

<p>
"And you will forgive me my treachery to yourself?"
</p>

<p>
"My dear Keith," she says, with a little quivering
smile.  "I knew you were making a cat's-paw of me,
but somehow I didn't mind that so much, if it would
have been any real good to you.  In time, I thought
perhaps you might have got fond of me.  Lots of men
are, you know; but I began to see that it wouldn't do&mdash;that
you couldn't take to me, and no wonder, when I was
so different to&mdash;her.  But as for forgiving, that's no big
thing to do.  And I never bear malice; 'tisn't in me.
Yes, you go right straight away out of the country, and
I'll make all this look natural enough, don't you fear.
You're not the first young man I've knocked off by
many.  I'm a born flirt, they say.  Well, I'm only acting
up to my character."
</p>

<p>
Behind the bright eyes is a weight of tears she longs
to shed, and will not.  The brave little heart is throbbing
and aching with pain.  But Keith sees nothing, suspects
nothing.  He is only relieved she takes it so well, that
after all she does not seem to care so very much.
</p>

<p>
He rises and holds out his hands.  "You are far too
good to me, Nan," he says brokenly.  "I feel ashamed
when I think of my conduct.  God bless you, child, and
make you happy."
</p>

<p>
"Too good to you," echoes Nan softly.  "I don't
know.  It strikes me, Keith, that you are just the sort of
fellow women would be 'good to.'  I surmise they
can't help it.  It's just your way with them, you know.
So it's really 'Good-bye.'  Take my advice and go to
the Rockies and shoot grizzlies.  That'll cure you if
anything will."
</p>

<p>
Not by any means a romantic parting, or a touching
one; but it is a very faithful heart that masks its pain
so bravely, and a very loving one too.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
A week later, and town is eagerly discussing two
startling pieces of news.  One is that Keith Athelstone,
the rich young American, has sailed for Timbuctoo or
Tahiti, or New Zealand, people are not quite sure which;
the other that Joel Salomans, the great millionaire, has
come to smash over some gigantic speculation, and has
blown his brains out in his hotel in Paris.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
In the deepest of mourning, with her handsome brows
drawn into an angry frown, with a pile of letters and
papers on the table before her, sits Lady Jean.  "It is
ruin, simply ruin!" she mutters fiercely, as she pushes
the pile impatiently aside and looks at the long column
of figures before her.
</p>

<p>
Ruin to her means some five hundred a year, secured
to herself, and a country house bought and settled on
her by Mr. Salomans a year before.  She is at present in
Paris.  It is a week since her husband's death, and the
scandal and <i>esclandre</i> are flying everywhere, and adorning
special articles in all the society journals.
</p>

<p>
Lady Jean feels very bitter against the dead man, and
very bitter against everything in general.  She has had
but few condolences, and those have been spiced with
feminine malice.  She is quite alone in her hotel in the
Rue Scribe, and her lawyer has worried her into a
headache this morning with explanations and formalities.
While she is in this unamiable mood the door opens,
and Sir Francis Vavasour enters.  Lady Jean blushes
scarlet as she rises to greet him.  To do her justice
the emotion is genuine enough.  She has thought
herself forsaken&mdash;forgotten.  "You&mdash;how good of you!"
she says, and holds out both her hands.  He takes
them and draws her towards him, and kisses her many
times.  She does not rebuke him; the days for pretence
have long been over between them.
</p>

<p>
"And so you are&mdash;free?" he says.
</p>

<p>
"And penniless and&mdash;disgraced, you should add," she
answers, sinking down on the couch by his side.  "This
horrible scandal will kill me, I think."  This is all her
regret for the dead man she has deceived, goaded,
embarrassed by her extravagances, and wantonly neglected
and ridiculed through all her married life.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, it won't," says Sir Francis consolingly.
"Scandal never killed any one yet, especially a woman.
But are things very bad?"
</p>

<p>
Lady Jean explains as well as she can the lawyer's
wearisome phrases, and her own definition of ruin.
</p>

<p>
"And what will you do?" asks Sir Francis.
</p>

<p>
"I have scarcely thought about it yet.  I can't live at
Norristown, it would be absurd.  I must let it.  Oh,
Frank, isn't it hard?  Fancy a life like this for&mdash;me!"
</p>

<p>
"It is a trial, certainly," he says, pulling his thick
moustache with an abstracted air.  "I don't know what
the deuce you're to do, unless you let me help you."
</p>

<p>
She laughs contemptuously.  "No, thank you.  We'll
stop short of money favours.  I haven't come to that yet."
</p>

<p>
"But what can you do?" persisted Sir Francis.
"Five hundred pounds a year!  Why, it wouldn't keep
you in gowns for three months&mdash;and do you expect to
eat, drink, pay rent, and clothe yourself, on such a
beggar's pittance?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I shall get into debt for a year, of course," says
Lady Jean coolly, "and then&mdash;marry&mdash;I suppose."
</p>

<p>
He turns very white.  "You say that to&mdash;me?"
</p>

<p>
"My dear Frank, why not?  You are a man of the
world; you don't suppose I am going to stagnate in
poverty and obscurity till some happy chance gives you
the freedom I possess.  Not I&mdash;pshaw! it is absurd.  I
must do the best for myself.  You are not surely so selfish
as to expect me to throw away a good chance for&mdash;you."
</p>

<p>
"I thought you loved me," he says gloomily; "you
told me so."
</p>

<p>
"Love you!  Of course I love you!  But what use&mdash;now,
any more than before?  Do you expect fidelity in a
case like ours?  We have both outlived the age of
romance, and now, of course, I must be doubly cautious not
to draw down calumny on my head.  Were you free it
would be a different matter.  But, of course, your wife
is a saint, and Keith Athelstone an anchorite.  Fraternal
affection, when unfettered by fraternity, is so pure and
beautiful a thing!"
</p>

<p>
He groans impatiently.  "I know what you mean.
But she never cared for him; and now he has broken
off his projected marriage, and left England."
</p>

<p>
Lady Jean looks up in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Left England?  Are you sure?"
</p>

<p>
"Lauraine said so, and every one is talking of it."
</p>

<p>
"Lauraine told you so!  Ah, how beautiful is faith!
Did I not tell you that marriage would never be?  What
reason does he give for breaking it off?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, the girl says she broke it off because they could
not agree about furnishing their drawing-room.  She is
as larky and perky as ever, and treats the whole thing
as a joke.  Has got the young Earl of Longleat mad
after her now, and I suppose will end in marrying him."
</p>

<p>
"And Keith has&mdash;left England," says Lady Jean
musingly; "or is that a blind?  Where is your saint?"
</p>

<p>
"Lauraine?  She is staying with her æsthetic friend
in Kensington.  No, Jean.  With all due respect to your
'cuteness, that won't do.  I tell you Lauraine doesn't
care two straws for the fellow, though he is madly in love
with her.  Why, I met him rushing out of the house like
a lunatic the day he came to say 'Good-bye.'  Never
saw a fellow in such a state in my life, and she&mdash;she was
as cool and cold as possible.  Said he was going away to
some foreign place or another."
</p>

<p>
"He has not gone!" says Lady Jean tranquilly.  "I
won't mind an even bet of a cool thou' on that point,
Frank.  While England holds Lauraine, it will hold
Keith Athelstone.  Of that I am quite convinced."
</p>

<p>
"I think you mistake her," says Sir Francis coldly.
</p>

<p>
"She is human, and she loves," answers Lady Jean.
"Of course she is of a much higher type than ordinary
women&mdash;cast in a nobler mould, and all that.  But
still&mdash;&mdash;"  She pauses meaningly.  Sir Francis moves
with sudden impatience.  "Why talk of her?" he
says.  "You know I hate her."
</p>

<p>
"I know nothing of the sort," retorts Lady Jean.
"You were very madly in love with her once, and you
paid a high enough price for your fancy, and you believe
in her still."
</p>

<p>
"One can respect a woman, even if one dislikes her,"
mutters Sir Francis.
</p>

<p>
Lady Jean's eyes flash fire beneath their lowered lids.
What she has forfeited she hates to hear praised as
another woman's possession.
</p>

<p>
"I am glad you find her such a paragon of virtue,"
she sneers.  "And it must be a novel sensation for you
to&mdash;respect&mdash;a woman."
</p>

<p>
"It is&mdash;rather," he answers in the same tone.  "There
are not many who give us the chance!"
</p>

<p>
"I think your visit has lasted long enough," says
Lady Jean coldly.  "As I told you before, I have to be
doubly careful of <i>les convenances</i>; I am glad you did
not give your name.  And please do not call again until I
send you word."
</p>

<p>
"You have grown mighty particular all of a sudden,"
exclaimed Sir Francis angrily.  "Why the deuce
shouldn't I call if I please?  We are old friends, and
surely&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, certainly we are old friends," says Lady Jean
maliciously.  "But you see it behoves me to be careful.
I have my future prospects to consider."
</p>

<p>
"Jean!  You are not in earnest, you are only trying me?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Mon cher</i>, I was never more in earnest in my life.
I am not going to be a martyr to one man's misguided
rashness, or another's selfish passion.  Not I indeed.
<i>Ce n'est pas mon métier</i>.  No; I shall do the best for
myself, as I have said before; and you will be magnanimous,
I know, and permit the&mdash;sacrifice."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know so much about that," says Sir Francis,
an evil light gleaming in his eyes.  "You are too much
to me for me ever to yield you up to another man.  Of
course before&mdash;well, that could not be helped.  But
now&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Now," says Lady Jean, with her cold smile, "you
have learnt that to <i>respect</i> a woman is better than to
love her.  I only wish to follow your good example.  I
should like to be able to&mdash;respect&mdash;a man."
</p>

<p>
"Then by all means don't marry one," retorts Sir
Francis.  "But, joking apart, Jean, you are not serious?
You are not going to throw me off in this fashion?"
</p>

<p>
"I said nothing about 'throwing off.'  I only said it
behoved me to be careful&mdash;doubly careful; and if you
come to see me now, you must come with&mdash;your wife."
</p>

<p>
"My wife!" He stares at her stupidly.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly.  As a widow I cannot receive constant
visits from married men unaccompanied by their wives.
It would never do.  I cannot suffer you to humiliate
me; I care too much for&mdash;myself!"
</p>

<p>
"I wish to heaven I could understand you," mutters
Sir Francis.  "Well, at all events, for a year, you can't
carry out your threat."
</p>

<p>
She has him in such complete subjugation that he
does not bluster or insist as with a weak-minded woman
he would have done.  Lady Jean has always ruled him
with a strong hand, as a bad woman will often rule a man
who yet owes her no fidelity, and has for her no respect.
</p>

<p>
"I may never carry it out," she says, with a sudden
softening of her voice.  "Perhaps, after all, I&mdash;love&mdash;you
too well, though you don't believe it.  But, as I
said before, of what use&mdash;of what use?"
</p>

<p>
His brow clears, his anger melts.  "If I could only
believe you!" he says.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" she answers, with humility, "if I had loved
<i>myself</i> better than you, I, too, might have had your
respect.  But I was not wise enough to be selfish."
</p>

<p>
"For your love I would forfeit any other consideration!"
he cries impetuously.  "You know that well
enough.  Whatever you desire, I will do it; only don't
forsake me."
</p>

<p>
"Whatever I desire," says Lady Jean, a slow, cruel
smile flitting over her face.  "Well, I will give you a
task.  Ask Keith Athelstone to Falcon's Chase for
Christmas."

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVII
</h3>

<p>
Lady Jean is right.  Keith Athelstone has <i>not</i> left
England.  His passage was taken, all his preparations made,
and then the very day before he was to sail he found
himself laid prostrate by brain fever.
</p>

<p>
He was taken ill in Liverpool, and his servant, being
one of that rare class who can give faithful attendance,
nursed him devotedly.  For weeks he lay hovering
between life and death, the strength and vigour of the
body fighting against the ravages of mental suffering,
and the long, painful strain on brain and heart against
which he had so long struggled.  In his delirious frenzy
his whole cry was for Lauraine.  It was pitiful to see
that strong young manhood bowed down to a child's
weakness.  As dependent as an infant on the hired
services which his wealth procured, but which was so
different to the tender ministry of love and friendship.
</p>

<p>
The discreet valet at times felt inclined to send to
Lady Vavasour, and acquaint her with his young
master's danger; but prudence withheld him.  He knew
she was married, and he feared to draw down his
master's anger by officious interference.
</p>

<p>
At last the doctors gave hope, and Keith struggled
back by slow degrees into convalescence, and saw his life
given back to his own keeping once more&mdash;life dull of
hue and sad enough, with all its gladness and colour
painted out by the ruthless hand of disappointment&mdash;life
for which he was in no way glad or grateful to the
mercy that had spared it; but still, life that he had to
accept and take up, with all its tangled threads and
broken hopes.
</p>

<p>
In the long, dreary days of convalescence he thought
of Lauraine as he had never thought of her yet&mdash;for
a wide gulf seemed to stretch between them now.  He
saw the headlong and undisciplined passion of his love
for her in its true colours&mdash;saw to what lengths it would
have gone, to what ruin it would have dragged her,
and a sense of shame and self-reproach filled his heart.
</p>

<p>
Some such thoughts as these came to Keith now as he
lay stretched on his couch during these dark winter days.
He felt weak enough to have uttered any prayer just for
Lauraine's presence, just to see the pity in her eyes, to
hear the thrill in her voice as she would look at his changed
face, and speak her gentle compassion.  At times like
these the slow hot tears of weakness would creep into his
eyes until he was fain to turn his head away from his
attendant's gaze, and make pretence of sleep in order
to have freedom to indulge his grief at leisure.
</p>

<p>
"I must never see her again, never, unless I have
grown dull and cold, and can greet her as a stranger," he
thinks to himself.  "How strange that I should love
her so.  I wonder will I ever be cured, or will this be the
'one passion of my life,' going down to my grave with
me even as it has filled all my days and hours?  Somehow,
I think it will.  I find it so hard to forget anything
concerning her.  Forget!  Why there is not a look in
her eyes, a word from her lips, not a dress or a flower
she has worn that I can forget; not a summer day or a
spring morning, not a season in the year that is not full
of some memory of her.  Oh, my love, my love, and to
think that you can be nothing to me&mdash;nothing!
</p>

<p>
"Shall I ever be old, I wonder?&mdash;and then shall I
have ceased to care?  Out of all the world of women
will there be only one for whom my heart will beat, my
pulses thrill, my whole soul long and love?  I have
tried to love other women&mdash;I have told them I love
them; but I don't think for one moment I deceived
myself, or them.  Men say the sins and follies of youth
come back to smite us as scourges in the after years; but
I suppose my love has kept me pure in a way, and will
do so.  It was never sin to me till her own act made it so,
for she seemed always mine in my thoughts and dreams,
and I alone seemed to have the right to her.  But now&mdash;well,
she was wiser than I when she bade me leave her.
This last year has only made us both more wretched.
And she is not happy&mdash;my darling!  Ah, when she
loved me there was not that sad look in her eyes, and
that brute is not even faithful.  But of that she knows
nothing, and, bad as I am, I wouldn't tell her so.  Let
her keep her faith unshaken, and live her life of duty.
Why should I make it harder than it is? .... Every
year now will take her further and further from me, and
yet I know she loves me.  I wonder what held me back
when I bade her farewell?  I could have taught her
forgetfulness then, if never before; and yet&mdash;and yet,
thank God, I did not.  I think to see her eyes reproach
me would be worse than this; I should feel inclined to
kill myself and&mdash;her.  Oh, God! what fools men can be
for a woman's sake!"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Some one comes softly into the room; it is Andrews
the careful and attentive.  He brings a letter in his
hand, and lays it down on the table by his young
master's side.  Keith turns towards him, and holds out a
thin transparent hand for the missive.  He tears open
the envelope, and as he looks at the address a flush
of colour steals over his face.
</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  "Falcon's Chase, Brockfield,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Northumberland.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"MY DEAR ATHELSTONE,
</p>

<p>
"We have only just heard of your illness, and are
much concerned about it, more especially as you are
alone at an hotel, and must be dependent on quite
alien services.  As soon as ever your health permits,
will you come to us here, and let us try to nurse you back
to health once more?  As the weather is so unusually
mild, I do not think you will find the air of Northumberland
too bracing.  Lauraine, of course, joins with me
in this invitation.  In fact, we can't hear of a refusal.
I will meet you in London, and come down with you as
soon as ever your physicians give you permission for the
journey.  With my kindest regards, and sympathy from
all mutual friends here,
</p>

<p>
  "Believe me, very sincerely yours,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"FRANCIS S. VAVASOUR."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Keith reads the letter steadily through to the end, and
his face grows white as the paper as he so reads it.  But a
new, stern look comes into his eyes, and his lips close
tight under their thick moustache.
</p>

<p>
"What does it mean?" he thinks, as he reads the
subtle tempting.  "Can Lauraine <i>really</i> have had any
hand in this?  I don't believe it.  No; I will not go.
The snare is too plainly set."  And before he can have
time to alter his mind he asks for pen and ink, and
dashes off a firm but courteous refusal on the plea of
his physicians ordering him to a warm climate.
</p>

<p>
"She shall never have to reproach me again if I can
help it," he says to himself, as exhausted with even this
small exertion, he sinks back on his pillows.  "She
called me selfish once.  Will she do so now?&mdash;now, when
for her sake&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
There is only a very small house party at Falcon's
Chase when Keith Athelstone's letter arrives, and the
master of the house reads it with a clouded brow.  He
has insisted upon his wife's asking Lady Jean down, and,
despite her recent bereavement, the Lady Jean accepts
the invitation.  She is very subdued, very mournful, lives
a great deal in her own rooms, and altogether affords
a very unobtrusive spectacle of chastened sorrow.  She
is more than ever gracious to her hostess, and dignified
to her host, and even Lady Etwynde's observant eyes
can see nothing in any way suspicious.
</p>

<p>
On the morning that Keith's letter arrives Lady Jean
is not at the breakfast-table and Sir Francis is impatient
to tell her the news&mdash;so impatient in fact, that for once
he forgets the prudence she has so strictly enjoined, and
sends her a note by her maid asking her to come into the
small study adjoining the library as soon as she can.
</p>

<p>
Lady Jean is annoyed at his imprudence, and in no
way hurries herself to suit his wishes.  When she at last
enters the study she finds Sir Francis fuming at being
kept waiting, and decidedly unamiable.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what is it?" she asks.
</p>

<p>
He hands her Keith's letter, and she reads it through.
Her brows cloud; she throws it aside impatiently.
</p>

<p>
"The young fool!" she mutters.
</p>

<p>
On entering the smaller room she has drawn the door
after her, but not quite closed it.  The velvet curtains
sweep down, and no one from the library can see them,
but the sound of their voices is audible.  It happens
that Lauraine enters the outer room for a book, and is
just taking it down from the case when the sound of her
own name, uttered by Lady Jean's voice, strikes sharply
on her ear.
</p>

<p>
"Does Lauraine know?"
</p>

<p>
"No," answers her husband's voice.  "As you advised,
I said nothing about it.  Had Athelstone accepted,
I would have told her that I had heard of his dangerous
illness, and asked him here to set him up again."
</p>

<p>
"How excessively provoking!" continues Lady Jean.
"Depend on it, Frank, this is a blind.  Either Keith
suspects we know of his love for your wife, or she has
been beforehand."
</p>

<p>
"My dear Jean!" exclaims Sir Francis.
</p>

<p>
Lauraine waits to hear no more.  Astonishment has
kept her spellbound.  Now she turns from the room with
a sickening, horrible sense of shame in her heart, with the
blood dyeing her white face, with all the dignity and
pride of womanhood stung and outraged by this
unexpected discovery.  Her husband and Lady Jean are
cognizant of Keith's mad passion for herself, have
actually plotted to bring him under her roof, to throw
them together once again.  For what purpose?
</p>

<p>
Like a lightning flash the whole terrible truth seems to
burst upon her.  Suspicions, hints, all take new shape by
the light of this new discovery&mdash;her husband's long
friendship for Lady Jean, his indifference to herself.
But that he could have stooped so low as to plan his
wife's dishonour for the sake of his own freedom&mdash;&mdash;  It
seems to her almost incredible.
</p>

<p>
The whole pitfall opened for her feet now confronts
her fully and clearly.  If Keith had accepted, if he had
come here&mdash;she unconscious of the invitation, and
unable to oppose it once so accepted&mdash;what then?
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my darling," she half sobs, "thank God you
were brave and true to your better self!  They may suspect
our love, but, as there is a Heaven above, they shall
never shame it to their own baseness!"
</p>

<p>
She kneels by her bed in an agony of weeping.  Fear,
shame, rage, disgust, sweep over her by turns.  She sees
the whole plot, and her own long blindness, and yet she
knows she is powerless to resent either!  If her husband
accuses her of loving Keith she cannot deny it, and to
explain to a mind so coarse and base the struggle and the
sufferings that love has cost her, would only bring down
ridicule and win her no belief.
</p>

<p>
She feels quite helpless.  Her enemy knows her secret,
and her evil mind will colour it and send it flying
abroad, and she is powerless to resent, or to deny.
</p>

<p>
A loathing, a horror of herself&mdash;of them&mdash;comes upon
her.  It seems to her scarcely possible that they could
have sunk so low, could have plotted anything so evil.
And then bitter thoughts come into her mind.  Of what
use to try and do right, to struggle, and sacrifice as she
has done?  Duty has brought to her only added shame,
only a crueller trial!
</p>

<p>
There is but one grain of comfort to her now in all
her sorrow.  It is that Keith has been brave and true to
his word, that for <i>her</i> sake he has forfeited self for once.
</p>

<p>
"Had he listened, had he come, he would have been a
coward," she says to herself, and then the thought of his
danger, his weakness, comes over her, and she weeps
wildly and passionately in her loneliness.  She dares
say no word of sympathy, dares show no sign; she, too,
must appear cold, unmoved, uncaring.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, dear Heaven!" she prays in her sorrow and her
pain.  "Where will it end&mdash;where will it end?  Will
my strength endure for my life?"
</p>

<p>
She had never felt so helpless, so desperate as now.
</p>

<p>
She could not think of any course of action to pursue,
and yet she knew she could not overlook this outrage to
herself.  That she should have under her roof as guest a
woman whose position with her own husband she could
no longer doubt, was impossible.  All her pride rose in
arms against such a possibility, and yet beyond all
things she dreaded to explain to Sir Francis her reasons,
and hear his hateful taunts and sneers against herself.
</p>

<p>
"And I am not blameless," she moans, pressing her
hands against her hot and throbbing temples.  "What
can I say for myself?"  As she kneels there, a knock
comes at her door.  She rises hurriedly, and opens it,
and confronts&mdash;her husband.
</p>

<p>
He comes in.  He does not look at her.
</p>

<p>
"Lauraine," he begins, "I just wanted to say a word
to you.  I have heard some bad news of young Athelstone
I wanted to tell you.  He has been dangerously ill&mdash;is
lying alone and friendless at an hotel in Liverpool.
I wish you would write and ask him to come here as soon
as he can travel&mdash;it seems such a sad thing, you know."
</p>

<p>
He stops abruptly.  He has repeated his lesson, and
feels a little uncomfortable.
</p>

<p>
Lauraine lifts her head very proudly.  Her voice, as
she speaks, goes through him like the touch of ice.
</p>

<p>
"Has Lady Jean counselled you to say all this?  Her
anxiety and&mdash;yours, for Mr. Athelstone are really most
praiseworthy.  All the same, you have had <i>his</i> answer to
your disinterested invitation.  It is scarcely necessary
for me to repeat it, even if I wished."
</p>

<p>
He looks at her with a dark flush mounting to his brow,
but flinches beneath the steady challenge of her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?" he demands hoarsely.
</p>

<p>
"I was in the library half-an-hour ago," says
Lauraine calmly.  "Only for a moment&mdash;do not fancy I
stooped to intentional eaves-dropping.  I think it is for
you to say whether Lady Jean Salomans&mdash;or I&mdash;leave
your house immediately."
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap28"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVIII
</h3>

<p>
There is a moment's silence, then Sir Francis turns and
confronts her with a face of sullen rage.
</p>

<p>
"What the devil do you mean?" he says fiercely.
"Are you going to insult her?"
</p>

<p>
"I think the insult is to me," says Lauraine, very
quietly.  "I have been blind a long time; but if you
can discuss my actions with another woman in the
familiar manner I heard you discussing them with Lady
Jean, it says enough to convince me of the terms of your
acquaintanceship.  I have no desire for any open scandal.
You can explain to your friend that her presence
here is no longer desirable.  That is all."
</p>

<p>
"All!" scoffs Sir Francis savagely.  "And do you
suppose I'm going to be dictated to by you as to who
stops in my house, or not?  A nice model of virtue and
propriety you are, to preach to other women!  A beggar,
who married me for my money, just as one of the vilest
women would have done&mdash;a woman who has been carrying
on a secret intrigue of her own for years, only is too
devilish clever to be found out."
</p>

<p>
Lauraine stops him with a gesture of infinite scorn.
"What you say is untrue.  That I married you without
any pretence of love, you know.  I make no secret
of it, and my mother and yourself both tried your
utmost to persuade me into it.  But since I married you, I
have at least been true.  Secret intrigues, as you call
them, are for women of Lady Jean's stamp, not mine."
</p>

<p>
"And what about your own friendship for Keith?"
sneers her husband.  "Do you deny he is your lover?"
</p>

<p>
"No," answers Lauraine, turning very white, but still
keeping her voice steady in its cold contempt.  "But
his love is worthy of the name; it is not a base, degrading
passion that steeps itself in deceit&mdash;that, holding one
face to the world, has another for the partner of its
baseness.  Keith has loved me from his boyhood.  I was
faithless to him, in a way; but I was not wholly to
blame.  For long after we met again I never suspected
but that the old love was dead and buried.  When I
found it was not&mdash;&mdash;"  She stops abruptly, and a sudden,
angry light comes into her eyes.  "Why do I stop
to explain?  You&mdash;you cannot even imagine what a
pure, self-denying love may be capable of!  I think you
have had your answer in his letter.  He knows better
than to palter with temptation.  He has more respect
for me, than you who claim to be&mdash;my husband."
</p>

<p>
His eyes droop in momentary shame, but the rage in
his heart is boiling with fiercer fury.  "A fine thing for
you to talk to me of your love for another man&mdash;of his
for you.  Pshaw! as if all men's love is not alike.  Do
you take me for a fool?  You never loved me, and since
your child died we have been almost strangers, and you
have had your lover with you often enough.  That he
has not accepted this invitation is to me no proof of what
you call virtue.  Perhaps he is tired of you.  It is likely."
</p>

<p>
All the blood seems to rush from Lauraine's heart to her
face at this insult.  She confronts him with a passion of
indignation.  "How <i>dare</i> you?" she cries; and then
something seems to rise in her throat and choke her.  The
utter futility of words&mdash;the sense of her own
imprudence&mdash;confront her like a barrier to the belief she would
invoke.  He sees he has stung her now almost beyond
endurance, and the knowledge rouses all that is worst in
him, and prompts but further outrage.  That his own
wrong-doing is discovered, that another woman has fallen
where she&mdash;his wife&mdash;stood firm, are but added
incentives to his jealous fury and defeated ends.
</p>

<p>
"How <i>dare</i> I?  You will find that I dare more than that,
madam.  I think you would not look much better than I
if we had a 'show up,' and as I live, if you insult Lady
Jean I will institute proceedings against you&mdash;with Keith
Athelstone as co-respondent."
</p>

<p>
And he leaves the room with a brutal laugh.
</p>

<p>
Lauraine stands there as if turned to stone.  For the
first time she feels how powerless she is&mdash;how helpless is
any woman when the man who has sworn to protect and
honour her, turns round on her and insults her with the
very weakness he is bound to respect.
</p>

<p>
She knows her husband is not faithful, that the very
presence of this woman beneath her roof is an outrage to
all decency and morality, and yet if she opposes that
presence, she herself is threatened with a life-long injury;
nay, more, Keith will be dragged in to shield the sharer
of this flagrant guilt, which is before her very eyes, and
which she seems powerless to resent.  She grows
desperate as she thinks of it&mdash;as she looks at the case
from every side, and yet sees no way of escape or
justice.
</p>

<p>
Of what use is innocence to a woman whose name is
before the world, and dragged through the mire of public
inquiry?  A thousand tongues will chatter, a thousand
scandals fly, to be magnified and retailed and charged
with vile suspicions.  She will be a public sport, a public
shame.  And Lauraine knew that this would be her
portion if she did not agree to hide the guilt of another
woman, and tacitly accept the charge laid against herself.
As she thought of it, all that was best and purest in
her nature rose in revolt.  All the courage and strength
that had given her power to resist her lover, seemed to
array themselves against the brutal tyranny and
shameful outrage she had been bidden to accept.
</p>

<p>
"I will not do it; I <i>will</i> not!" she cries aloud, as she
paces to and fro her room.  "After all I am rightly
punished.  I was false to him, and it was wrong to
allow him to be so much with me, once I knew he loved
me still.  Now, whichever way I look at it, there seems
nothing but shame and dishonour."
</p>

<p>
It seemed to her right&mdash;nay, but common justice&mdash;that
she should suffer; but she hated to think of Keith
being condemned to like torture, of the shame that would
be about his life, did her husband carry out his threat.
Where, indeed, would the results of this fatal love end?
To what depths of misery had it not led, and still seemed
to be leading them?
</p>

<p>
Divorce had always seemed to Lauraine a shameful
thing&mdash;a necessary evil sometimes, but still something
with a stigma of disgrace, that, whether merited or not,
always dogged and haunted a woman all her life.  And
now she could plainly see to what end her husband and
Lady Jean were driving her as their scapegoat.
</p>

<p>
By her means they wished to vindicate themselves;
and, remembering how easily their plot might have been
carried out, she shudders and turns sick with loathing and
shame unutterable.
</p>

<p>
Keith, in his weakness and loneliness, might have been
enticed here apparently by her wish.  There would have
been hours of languor and convalescence, during which
they would have been together&mdash;hours when the softness
of pity in her own heart and the awakened memories of
his would have held all the old power, and all the long
fought-against danger.  But she sees still that the plot
is not defeated, that she has a subtle foe to combat, and in
all her scorn and wrath Lauraine yet feels the miserable
conviction of her own impotence oppressing her.
</p>

<p>
The hours pass.  Of time she takes no count or heed;
only lies there prostrate and sick at heart, and desolate,
and ashamed; feeling that a great crisis in her life has
come, and she cannot tell how to deal with it.
</p>

<p>
The luncheon-bell rings, but she sends a message that she
is ill and cannot come downstairs.  Another hour passes,
and still she does not move, only lies there in a sort of
stupor of misery and bewilderment.
</p>

<p>
There comes a gentle knock at the door, and she hears
Lady Etwynde's voice asking permission to enter.
</p>

<p>
Wearily enough she gives it.  All sympathy seems
useless to her, and her friend's perfect happiness seems to
show up in but sharper contrast her own wretched life.
Lady Etwynde guesses instinctively that something
is wrong.  Neither Lady Jean nor Lauraine has appeared
at luncheon, and Sir Francis has looked like a human
thundercloud all the time.  She comes forward now
and kneels by Lauraine's side.
</p>

<p>
"What has happened, dear?" she asks.  "Are you ill?"
</p>

<p>
"Ill enough in mind," answers Lauraine, and then
she tells her all.  Lady Etwynde listens in silence, but
her beautiful eyes grow dark with indignation and scorn.
</p>

<p>
"It is all that hateful woman, of course," she says at
last.  "Oh, my dear, my dear, what will you do now?"
</p>

<p>
"I cannot tell," says Lauraine despairingly.  "Accept
such an outrage as this, I cannot, and yet if I insist&mdash;well,
I told you his threat."
</p>

<p>
"But that is absurd!" exclaims Lady Etwynde
indignantly.  "He has not a shadow of proof.  No
judge would listen to such a case.  It is only a threat,
Lauraine; and that woman has put him up to it."
</p>

<p>
"But in any case the disgrace would be the same," says
Lauraine.  "I was so blind, so foolish.  Every one
seems to have noticed Keith's devotion to me, and I&mdash;it
was so long before I suspected it."
</p>

<p>
"The lookers-on always see most, you know.  But
still all this proves nothing, and I don't believe your
husband would seriously think of dragging his name and
yours into one of those courts without a tittle of evidence
to support his accusation."
</p>

<p>
"Evidence can be bought," says Lauraine; "and even
were it to come to nothing, there is the shame, the scandal.
Oh, my poor Keith!  It was an evil fate that threw us
two together again."
</p>

<p>
For a moment Lady Etwynde is silent.  She is deeply
troubled.  She knows well enough that, be a woman ever
so innocent, the breath of public discussion will tarnish
her fame for ever,  A sense of injustice, of anger, rises
in her heart, and fills it with hot, indignant thoughts.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot counsel you to submit," she says.
</p>

<p>
"I do not mean to submit," answers Lauraine tranquilly.
"It would look like fear.  I must face the worst.
For myself, I do not care so much; I have been unhappy
so long&mdash;but it is of Keith I think."
</p>

<p>
"My dear!" exclaims Lady Etwynde, "spare your
pity!  A man never suffers in these cases; it is always
the woman&mdash;always.  The more guiltless, the more
society will shun her.  It is a sort of way it has for
condoning its own errors and impurities.  It looks well to make
a violent outcry when any one has been so foolish as to
be found out.  As long as you sin in the dark, no one
will dream of saying a word, let their suspicions be ever
so strong.  A woman like you, Lauraine, who has only been
imprudent and sorely tempted, and yet dares to be
virtuous, will receive no mercy and gain no belief."
</p>

<p>
"I know that," she says, and her indifference is
scarcely forced now.  She feels too hopeless for strong
emotion.
</p>

<p>
"As for Keith," goes on Lady Etwynde impatiently,
"it is all owing to his selfishness and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hush!" cries Lauraine sternly.  "I will not have
him blamed.  He has been sorely tried, and many men
would have acted far worse.  It is on me that all the
blame lies&mdash;on me only.  It all began from the fatal
error of my marriage, and I deserve to suffer, I know;
only sometimes, Etwynde," she adds wearily, "it does
seem as if the suffering was beyond my strength."
</p>

<p>
The tears spring to Lady Etwynde's eyes.
</p>

<p>
"What <i>will</i> you do?" she asks despairingly.
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow I will tell Lady Jean that it is best for
her visit to terminate," answers Lauraine.  "I do not
see why I should condone my own shame.  As for the
consequences, Sir Francis must do what he pleases.  I
know I am innocent, even if blameable&mdash;the result, time
will show."
</p>

<p>
"I think you are quite right," says Lady Etwynde.
"But I am afraid you will suffer for it.  Lady Jean is
a dangerous woman to offend."
</p>

<p>
Lauraine pushes the hair off her temples as if the
weight oppressed her.  "I do not expect anything else
but suffering now.  And I may as well endure it for right
as for wrong.  If I have respected my husband's name,
at least he might respect mine."
</p>

<p>
"And whatever you do be sure of this," says Lady
Etwynde gently: "my house is always open to you.  Let
the whole world turn its back upon you, Lauraine, my
friendship will never fail."  Lauraine looks up at the
beautiful face.  Her heart is too full for words.
</p>

<p>
But when she is alone again a great fear chills her.  "I
have done right," she says.  "But&mdash;what will it cost?"

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIX
</h3>

<p>
All through that day Lauraine keeps in her own room.
Sir Francis does not approach her.  He is quite confident
that his threat has taken effect&mdash;that she will never
proceed to extremities.  He has not seen Lady Jean to tell
her of his wife's discovery, and he dares not send her
another message.  When he goes down to dinner he
finds his wife in the drawing-room.  She looks very pale,
and is dressed in black velvet.  Lady Etwynde is beside
her, and Colonel Carlisle is standing near.
</p>

<p>
Sir Francis has scarcely entered the room when Lady
Jean follows.  She and Lauraine have not met that day.
She walks up to her hostess, extending her hand.
</p>

<p>
Lauraine draws her slender figure up to its full height,
and, with a cold bow, turns aside to speak to Colonel
Carlisle.  For an instant Lady Jean looks at her as if
stunned.  Then the blood rushes in a torrent to her face
and neck.  She knows the meaning of such an action only
too well.  Dinner is announced now, and Sir Francis,
who has also observed this act of his wife's, offers his arm
to Lady Jean.  Colonel Carlisle does the same to
Lauraine, and Lady Etwynde follows.
</p>

<p>
The dinner is a dreary affair.  Each of them feels a
scene is impending, and Colonel Carlisle, who has some
inkling of how matters stand, is very uncomfortable.
He resolves that on the morrow Etwynde and himself
must quit Falcon's Chase, sorry as he is for, and much as
he admires, Lauraine.  The ladies rise to leave the table,
and pass out of the room.  Before entering the drawing-room
Lady Jean bends down to Lauraine.
</p>

<p>
"Will you be good enough to explain the meaning of
your strange behaviour?" she says.
</p>

<p>
Lauraine turns and faces her unflinchingly.  "You
must excuse me from entering upon any discussion with
you," she says haughtily.  "You will find a note in
your own apartment that will fully explain everything&mdash;not
that I fancy such explanation is needed."
</p>

<p>
Lady Jean's handsome, sparkling face changes to a dull,
ashy grey.  She to be insulted thus, to her face, and by a
woman whom she despises and hates as a rival!  Her
teeth clench like a vice.  She is too wise to bandy words;
she only turns and walks straight to her own suite of
rooms, and there sees the letter spoken of.  Tearing it
open like a fury, she reads the few curt lines in which
Lauraine states that circumstances render it advisable
her visit should come to an end, and refers her, for any
explanation she may deem necessary, to Sir Francis.
</p>

<p>
To say that Lady Jean is furious would but ill convey
an idea of the tempest of rage, hatred, and spite aroused
in her heart by the knowledge that she is discovered.
</p>

<p>
"How could she have found out, and so suddenly?"
she mutters to herself.  "He had no letters of mine to
leave about.  I was never such a fool as to write to him,
and to-day she has been shut up in her rooms, and I have
not met Frank.  Ah, the library&mdash;I forgot that.  Good
heavens! could she have overheard?"
</p>

<p>
She trembles with mingled rage and shame.  If Lauraine
had stood before her now she could have killed her
without a regret, crushed out her youth and beauty with
ruthless hands and rejoicing heart; but Lauraine is not
there, and Lauraine has all the triumph, and she all the
shame and defeat.  Like a wounded tigress she paces to
and fro her room, a thousand schemes and projects
flashing through her brain, and all the fierceness and
savagery of her nature roused into an insensate, furious
longing to revenge this insult, as she terms it, upon the
woman who has dealt it to her.
</p>

<p>
And at this moment, and while she is in this mood,
Sir Francis enters.
</p>

<p>
Lady Jean turns upon him like a beautiful fury.  "So&mdash;you
have been fool enough to let her find out," she
says, in a low, choked voice.  "Read that."
</p>

<p>
He glances over his wife's letter.  He is enraged also.
He had not thought she would have courage to act like
this.  "By Heaven! she shall suffer for it!" he mutters
savagely.  "She has dared to defy me, after all!"
</p>

<p>
"Defy you?" echoes Lady Jean.  "Did you know then?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly; I knew since the morning," he answers.
"She was in the library&mdash;she heard us."
</p>

<p>
"Did I not tell you, you were an imbecile," screams
Lady Jean, "to send me a message&mdash;to ask me to come to
that room; and now&mdash;now&mdash;  Great Heaven! what am
I to do?  I am ruined, and all through your idiocy?"
</p>

<p>
A woman always turns round on a man when there is a
question of inconvenience to herself.  Sir Francis stands
there sullen and raging, but he is equally at a loss what to
counsel.  "I am master here," he says presently.  "You
shall not go."
</p>

<p>
Lady Jean laughs in his face.  "Master here?&mdash;oh, no
doubt!  You should have exercised your mastership in
time, then; now it is too late.  Your wife and I cannot
remain under the same roof.  Why, do you suppose that
for a single moment I should stay to put up with her
insults?  Are you really such a fool?  No; it is good-bye
to you both from to-night, only don't let her <i>dare</i> to
breathe a word of this to the world, or it will be the very
worst day of her life&mdash;that I swear!"
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye!&mdash;what do you mean?" says sir Francis
stupidly.  "Do you think I am going to give you up
for that puling, white-faced piece of virtue who calls herself
my wife?  By Heaven, no!"
</p>

<p>
"You seem to forget that you were mad to have that
same puling, white-faced nonentity for your wife once
upon a time!" sneers Lady Jean.  "You bought your
toy, and now must keep it.  I leave your roof to-morrow,
and never again do we two meet, unless&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She pauses meaningly.  He seizes her by the arm.
</p>

<p>
"Don't drive me desperate.  You know I cannot give
you up.  You shall not&mdash;must not go.  I have a hold on
Lauraine.  She is afraid.  There is all that about&mdash;Keith."
</p>

<p>
Lady Jean shakes off his hand and laughs mockingly.
"About Keith!  Pshaw!  They were too wise for us,
<i>mon ami</i>.  Don't fancy you can do anything there.  Of
course they were in love&mdash;every one knows that; but I
doubt if you have a handle for a 'case,' if that is what you
mean.  And if Lauraine were afraid of you, would she
have written&mdash;this?"
</p>

<p>
She stands before him&mdash;that letter in her hand, and all
that is worst in her whole nature roused and stung by the
justice that she deems an insult.  Sir Francis is quite at a
loss.  That Lauraine has so coolly disregarded his threats
seems to augur her own fearlessness and her own innocence.
He feels an involuntary respect for her despite his anger
and the fury of baffled schemes.  It had never occurred
to him that she would be brave enough to act thus.
She has openly defied him, and that defiance rouses in
him a longing for vengeance&mdash;a hatred of the purity of
principle that has been tempted and yet stood firm&mdash;that
in the weakness of a woman's nature had been strong
as never was his manhood; that confronts him now
unshamed and undaunted, and ready to bear the cost of
the most terrible vengeance that could present itself
to a woman of Lauraine's nature.
</p>

<p>
"Would she?" persists Lady Jean, enraged at his
silence.  "Afraid!&mdash;she is fearless enough, trust her.
She has been too clever for us both, and there remains
nothing for it but to make the best of it.  I will have no
scene, no scandal.  I leave your house to-morrow, and
never again do I set foot in it, or receive you."
</p>

<p>
"And you think I will suffer this?" cries Sir Francis.
"That I am going to part from a woman I love for the sake
of one I hate?"
</p>

<p>
"I think you cannot help yourself," answers Lady
Jean coolly.  "I mean what I have said.  Now&mdash;go.  I
don't want to create further scandal, and your presence
here at this time is somewhat singular, to say the least."
</p>

<p>
"Jean, do not drive me mad!" cried Sir Francis
desperately.  "You are clever, keen of wit.  Surely you
can devise some plan by which we can defeat her?  It
is humiliating, unbearable to be baffled like this."
</p>

<p>
"She has seen through our scheme; she is prepared,"
scoffs Lady Jean.  "Don't praise me for keen wits or
cleverness, <i>mon ami</i>; you can admire them more safely
as exemplified by your wife!  Now&mdash;will you go?"
</p>

<p>
"Not unless you tell me when I am to see you again."
</p>

<p>
"Never, never, never!" almost screams Lady Jean.
"Is that enough?  <i>Never again</i>, I swear, unless your
wife is&mdash;to all intents and appearances&mdash;what she has
deemed me!  As that will never be, I think you must
resign yourself as philosophically as possible to an eternal
parting."
</p>

<p>
"How heartless you are!" cries Sir Francis.  "You
cannot mean it.  We might meet sometimes.  There is
no kind of&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, fool&mdash;dolt!" cries Lady Jean, in a fury.  "Have
I not said enough?  It is to you I owe this insult.  You
can pay the penalty of it.  You have nothing to do now
but put up with your bargain, or&mdash;wait for freedom!"
</p>

<p>
"Freedom," he mutters, vaguely and stupidly.  "Do
you mean that I should try for a divorce?"
</p>

<p>
She opens the door and pushes him aside.  "I have
said all that is necessary.  It is for you to act!"
</p>

<p>
"Act," he says.  For a moment he hesitates, then goes
forward and firmly closes the door.  "I will <i>not</i> go till I
have said my say.  I warned Lauraine that if she did
this I would proceed to extremities.  I shall do so.  She
has defied me for the first time in her life.  Well, she
shall suffer for it.  If you leave my roof she leaves it too.
She has chosen to insult you; let her have her share of the
disgrace."
</p>

<p>
Lady Jean looks at him as if bewildered.
</p>

<p>
"I think you know very well what I mean," he says
gloomily.  "You were the first to counsel it."
</p>

<p>
"But the scandal, the disgrace," cries Lady Jean
hurriedly.  "And then all this will leak out, and it will
look like a trumped-up case, done to shield yourself.  And
my name&mdash;&mdash;  No, no, I cannot have it.  She is right.
Let her have her triumph; it won't last long.  There are
other ways to punish her besides this.  Leave it to me.
I must be calm.  I must think.  No; <i>that</i> idea is ridiculous.
You may drag her name through the dirt, but you
drag your own also, and she can always bring up&mdash;this.
And, though I hate her, I know she is a good woman.
She is cold; that is her safeguard, for she never loved you.
But all the same she will not forfeit her own self-respect.
It is only another sort of pride, but it is <i>safe</i>."
</p>

<p>
"And yet you always said&mdash;" begins Sir Francis.
</p>

<p>
"Said," and she laughs her old mocking laugh.  "Of
course I <i>said</i>, of course I say it still; but then proofs are
different.  She loves Keith Athelstone, and he loves her;
and you&mdash;love me.  It is a triangle that you can't make
into a square.  She has the best of it now.  Let her alone,
and let her triumph.  It may be my turn next."
</p>

<p>
Infatuated as Sir Francis is, something in the cold,
measured hatred of this woman's last words strikes upon
him with a chill almost of fear.  He would rather have seen
her furious, violent, tempestuous, than as she looked
now.  She was not the sort of woman to care for a "waiting
race," and he knew some deeper purpose underlaid her
words.  She turns on him suddenly again, and stamps
her foot.  "<i>Will</i> you go?  Do you wish to disgrace me
publicly?  Have I not suffered enough at your hands?"
</p>

<p>
"But you will write; you will tell me where you are?"
he implores.
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;yes; I will write.  Only go.  I must be alone;
I must think.  And to-morrow I leave.  Arrange all
that."  He leaves her then, and Lady Jean rings her bell
and bids her maid pack immediately; she has received
news that necessitates her return to Paris.
</p>

<p>
Early next morning she leaves the Chase.
</p>

<p>
Her hostess does not appear, or send any message of
farewell.  Sir Francis drives his guest away to the station.
He has not seen or spoken to his wife.
</p>

<p>
"You have triumphed," says Lady Etwynde, standing
by Lauraine's side, and watching the carriage as it
disappears down the great oak avenue.
</p>

<p>
"Triumphed?"  Lauraine sighs heavily as she turns
her aching eyes away from the dark forest glades that
stretch for miles around.  "It is a poor triumph, Etwynde,
and laden with bitter memories, and weighted with many
fears.  Something tells me that I shall suffer for this before
long."  And Lady Etwynde echoes that fear in her own
heart, though now she speaks all brave and cheering
words that her tender love can frame.
</p>

<p>
"How will it end?" she thinks despairingly.  "How
will it end?"  Perhaps it was well that she could not tell
at that hour, in that time.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXX
</h3>

<p>
"Why does Lauraine not come to town?" says Mrs. Douglas,
impatiently, to Lady Etwynde.  "She must be
moped to death in that dreary Northumberland place.
It gives me the horrors even to think of it."
</p>

<p>
It is a cold afternoon in February, and it is Lady
Etwynde's "day," but the æsthetes are deserting her
now.  Her marriage is fixed for the end of the month.
It is to be very quiet, and Lauraine has written to say
she cannot come to it; her health is so delicate, that all
excitement and fatigue are forbidden.  But the real
truth is, that Sir Francis has developed a new system of
tyranny, framed in by every species of insulting suspicion,
and has ordered Lauraine to remain at Falcon's Chase,
and declared she shall not even go up to London for the
season.  It is childish, it is cowardly, and it is unreasonable,
and he knows it is all these; but he is infuriated with her,
and savage at the failure of his schemes, and this is the
only sort of revenge that he can think of at present.  He
himself is in Paris, with all the gaieties and amusements of
the season awaiting his selection, but chafing inwardly
and fiercely at Lady Jean's strange conduct, and
complete avoidance of himself.
</p>

<p>
Of course she goes nowhere&mdash;her deep mourning compels
retirement&mdash;but she has a small circle of friends who come
to her afternoons in her pretty rooms in the Rue Victoire,
and Sir Francis knows this, and knows that he is always
excluded, and the fact makes him more irritable, more
bitter against his wife, and more impatient of seeing his
mistress than he has ever been since they parted at the
Chase.  "How long am I to wait?" he wonders
impatiently.  "What can be her meaning?"
</p>

<p>
As yet neither of these questions seemed destined to be
answered.
</p>

<p>
"I know there is something," persists Mrs. Douglas,
drawing near to the fire in the pretty artistic drawing-room,
and dropping her voice confidentially.  "It looks
so odd, and Sir Francis is never with her now.  Do
tell me, Lady Etwynde, was there anything&mdash;anything
wrong&mdash;when you were down there at Christmas?"
</p>

<p>
"I think Lauraine is most unhappy," says Lady
Etwynde sorrowfully; "and I think her marriage was a
great mistake.  I often heard you congratulating yourself
and her&mdash;on its brilliance, Mrs. Douglas; but I think,
could you see behind the scenes and look into your
daughter's breaking heart, you would not feel quite so
proud, or so satisfied respecting it."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Douglas looks at her annoyed and impatient.
</p>

<p>
"If she is unhappy it must be her own fault.  She
had everything that could make a woman happy, and her
husband was devoted to her.  If she has lost his affection,
it is by her own imprudence and folly.  I warned her long
ago how it would be."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps your warning came too late.  Most warnings
do," says Lady Etwynde coldly.  "But a loveless
marriage to a girl of Lauraine's disposition and nature
was a dangerous experiment.  You ought to have let her
marry Keith Athelstone."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Douglas' eyes flash angrily.  "I suppose you are
in her confidence.  I acted for the best.  Keith was always
wild and rash, and not at all a suitable match; and,
besides that, she was not in love with him&mdash;or, at least,
never told me so.  She was quite content to marry Sir
Francis."
</p>

<p>
"She could have known nothing of his reputation,
then," answers Lady Etwynde.  "He was always a bad,
fast man; and he has treated Lauraine abominably."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Douglas looks at her with increased curiosity.
"What has he done?  Is it about&mdash;Lady Jean?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," answers Lady Etwynde, colouring.  "Lauraine
knows now what the world has long suspected; and
when she would not allow that woman to remain under
her roof, Sir Francis threatened her with proceedings and
dragged in poor Keith Athelstone's name."
</p>

<p>
"Good Heavens!" exclaims Mrs. Douglas, "what
scandal&mdash;what horror!  Oh, surely he is not in earnest?
Why, Lauraine is a fool&mdash;a perfect fool!  Why did she
make a scene about it?  Of course, every one knows such
things happen constantly.  Men are never
faithful&mdash;never!  But to insult the woman&mdash;and for what good?
To think that a daughter of mine should have been such
an idiot?"
</p>

<p>
"It does seem remarkable, doesn't it?" says Lady
Etwynde dryly.  "You see women nowadays generally
prefer worldly advantage to their own self-respect."
</p>

<p>
"Self-respect!  Fiddlesticks!" cries Mrs. Douglas,
growing more and more irate.  "Will self-respect give
her her present position, or gain the world's belief in
her innocence if she is once in the Divorce Court?
Self-respect!  I hate such rubbish.  She had everything she
wanted; why could she not have been content?"
</p>

<p>
"I dare say you would never understand why,"
answers Lady Etwynde calmly.  "Lauraine is singularly
unlike yourself."
</p>

<p>
"Lauraine is a fool&mdash;a perfect fool!" cries Mrs. Douglas
furiously.  "To get herself into a scrape like this, and
all for nothing; to insult a woman of Lady Jean's
position, and then to get herself talked about as she's
done with that young idiot Keith, and simply because
of some childish folly long ago, when they fancied
themselves in love with each other!  Why, she must
have taken leave of her senses, and all this time she
has not said a word to me&mdash;her own mother!"
</p>

<p>
Lady Etwynde is silent.  She is thinking it would have
been stranger still if Lauraine <i>had</i> taken her mother into
her confidence.
</p>

<p>
"I am sure Sir Francis was always most kind to her,"
resumes Mrs. Douglas presently.  "Always when I have
seen them together."
</p>

<p>
"I believe it is not a rule in good society for husband
and wife to quarrel openly," remarks Lady Etwynde.
</p>

<p>
"She should have been content and sensible like other
people," goes on Mrs. Douglas, disregarding the
interruption.  "Good gracious, every one knows such things
go on.  You can't make saints of men.  You must take
them as they are.  And did she actually make Lady
Jean leave the house?"
</p>

<p>
"She would have been scarcely less guilty than Lady
Jean had she condoned her presence, knowing what she
knew," says Lady Etwynde, with rising indignation.
"Even if a husband does not love his wife, he at least
should treat her with common decency."
</p>

<p>
"I daresay Lauraine brought it all on herself.  A man
can't always put up with such airs as those to which she
treated Sir Francis, and, in contrast with Lady Jean, why
Lauraine was&mdash;nothing."
</p>

<p>
"No," agrees Lady Etwynde.  "A good woman and
pure-minded generally looks colourless and tame beside
a wicked one.  The contrast is too strong I suppose."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Douglas looks at her sharply.  She does not like
her tone, nor understand it.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I only hope it will come right," she says.  "I
shall write to Lauraine and advise her to make it up with
her husband.  It is so stupid, making a fuss and
<i>exposé</i>&mdash;losing everything, and all for&mdash;what?"
</p>

<p>
"I think," says Lady Etwynde quietly, "that you
do not understand your daughter, and you do her
injustice.  A woman must know when to support her own
dignity; I suppose you allow that?"
</p>

<p>
"I daresay Lauraine made a great deal of unnecessary
fuss; it would be just like her.  She is full of romance and
high-flown ideas.  If she had been quite circumspect
herself it would not matter; but after getting herself
talked about with Keith&mdash;I myself had to warn her&mdash;I
think Sir Francis was very good to overlook it."
</p>

<p>
"Sir Francis perhaps had his own aims to attain,"
interpolates Lady Etwynde.  "I am inclined to think so,
judging by results."
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean&mdash;do you really think he wishes for
freedom?" gasps Mrs. Douglas.  "Is it so bad as that?"
</p>

<p>
"Lady Jean seems to have infatuated him," answers
Lady Etwynde.  "He was always weak where women
were concerned, you know.  He has treated Lauraine
very badly and he is even now in Paris."
</p>

<p>
"I think I will go down to Falcon's Chase," says
Mrs. Douglas presently.  "I must see Lauraine and advise
her.  It is really most critical.  I had no idea things
were so bad.  She has not chosen to take me into her
confidence; still, as her mother, it is my duty to see she
does not ruin her whole future."
</p>

<p>
"I think," says Lady Etwynde, very quietly, "I
would not go if I were you."
</p>

<p>
"Why not?" demands Mrs. Douglas sharply.
</p>

<p>
"She might not like it," answers Lady Etwynde;
"and you can do no good&mdash;no one can.  Lauraine is proud,
but she is also high-principled.  I do not think you need
fear for her.  What is right to do she will do, at any cost.
Sir Francis has not carried out his threat, and I fancy he
won't.  He has ordered Lauraine to remain in Northumberland;
but I do not think that is any great punishment
to her.  She always loved the Chase, and all her
memories of her child are with it."
</p>

<p>
"It is a pity the child died," says Mrs. Douglas.
</p>

<p>
"You may well say that.  He would at least have been
some consolation to her now.  Not that it would have made
any difference to Sir Francis.  He never cared for the
boy.  Still it was a tie."
</p>

<p>
"Lauraine must have been in fault," complains
Mrs. Douglas fretfully.  "It is all nonsense to say she is a
martyr&mdash;Sir Francis was no worse than other men.  If
she had been less cold, less odd, he would never have run
after other women."
</p>

<p>
"I do not agree with you," interrupts Lady Etwynde.
"Sir Francis is just what he always was&mdash;a thoroughly
selfish man, and a man whose habits are ingrained in
every fibre of his nature.  He has never treated women with
any respect, and his passion for Lauraine was as short-lived
as any of his other fancies.  He married her because&mdash;well,
you know the real reason as well as you know
the man, and in two years he was tired of her.  For a
woman, young, beautiful, warm-hearted, she has had a
most trying life, and a most cruel experience.  Had she
indeed been what hundreds of others are, she might
have consoled herself easily enough; but she could not do
that, and&mdash;she has her reward."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Douglas is silent and uncomfortable.  "It is a
great pity," she says at last.  "A great pity.  And one
can really do nothing?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing, except wait and hope."
</p>

<p>
Then the door opens and Colonel Carlisle enters, and a
beautiful flush and light come over her face as she greets
him.  Mrs. Douglas looks at her radiant eyes and sees his
proud and tender glance, and hears the happy ring in
their answering voices, and as she goes out and leaves
them alone a little uncomfortable feeling rises in her heart.
"Is there something in love, after all?" she asks herself.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"What has that woman been saying?" asks Colonel
Carlisle, as the door closes and he seats himself by his
betrothed.  "You looked worried when I came in."
</p>

<p>
"She always does worry me, I think," says Lady
Etwynde, nestling closer to his side, as the strong arm
draws her towards him.  "She is so worldly, so cold, so
heartless; and I hate to hear a mother speak of her
daughter as she speaks of Lauraine."
</p>

<p>
"They seem totally unlike each other," says the
Colonel.  "Poor Lauraine!  Have you any news?"
</p>

<p>
"I had a letter this morning.  She cannot come up
for our marriage.  Of course, Sir Francis won't let her&mdash;that
is the real truth.  It is a little bit of spite on his part."
</p>

<p>
"What an unfortunate marriage that was!" exclaims
Colonel Carlisle involuntarily.  "Ah, my darling, thank
God that we shall have love and sympathy on which to
base ours.  There is no hell upon earth like a union where
there is no love, no respect, no single thought or feeling
shared in common&mdash;where one's nature revolts and one's
duty demands submission&mdash;where the sacredness of
home is violated every hour until the name becomes a
mockery&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Poor Lauraine!&mdash;what she has missed!" Lady
Etwynde sighs.
</p>

<p>
"She had not your constancy, my darling!" murmurs
her lover.  "To think that for all these years you held
me shrined in the proud little heart that I thought so cold
and unforgiving once!  How true a love was yours!"
</p>

<p>
"It had need to be true if it was so unforgiving," she
says, smiling up into the dark eyes that search her own.
"When I think of those long, wasted years&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Do not think of them," he interrupts passionately,
"or think of them only to crowd into those that are to
come, a double portion of the love they have missed."
</p>

<p>
And with his lips on hers she is content, indeed, that it
should be so.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXI
</h3>

<p>
Alone in her rooms in Paris, Lady Jean sits perplexing
herself over ways and means.  She is awfully in debt, even
though she has let the country-house, and supplemented
her income by another five hundred a year.  She is angry
with herself for having refused Sir Francis' assistance
and too proud to call him to her side.  She can think
of no scheme by which to baffle Lauraine, and though she
knows her rival is condemned to a species of exile, and
that she is as unhappy as a woman can well be, that in no
way comforts her for the fact of her own defeat.
</p>

<p>
Her position is full of peril and uncertainty.  She can no
longer float on the smooth waters of Society, for Society
is shocked and outraged by her husband's misdeeds, and
an ill odour clings to her name.  The people she gathers
round her now are not at all the class of people she
prefers.  Needy foreigners, second-rate celebrities;
Englishmen with shady reputations and tarnished titles;
French Bohemians who have known and admired her in
the days of her success&mdash;all these congregate together at
her little rooms in the Rue Victoire; and among them
all she looks for some willing tool who will lend himself
to her hand and work out her schemes.
</p>

<p>
But for long she looks in vain.
</p>

<p>
The winter passes on.  The cool, fresh days of early
spring are heralded by bursts of sunshine, by the tender
budding leafage of the Boulevards, by the scents and hues
of flowers that are piled up in the baskets of the market
women, and fill the windows of the <i>fleuristes</i> with
brilliance and beauty once again.  And in the springtime,
suddenly and without warning, Lady Jean's scheme of
vengeance comes to her as a vision of possibility at last,
for who should come to Paris but Keith Athelstone.
</p>

<p>
He has been wintering in the south of France.  He
comes to the gay city with no set purpose, or desire.
He is alone, and melancholy, and depressed.  He thinks
he will have a fortnight in Paris, and then start for that
long-projected American tour, and the first person he sees
and greets in Paris is the Lady Jean.
</p>

<p>
She has never been a favourite of his, and he is inclined
to be curt and avoid her.  But she had other schemes in
her head, and, unless a man is absolutely discourteous, it
is not easy for him to baffle a woman who has set her
mind upon deluding him, especially a woman clever and
keen as the Lady Jean.
</p>

<p>
She is very quiet, very subdued.  All the fastness and
wildness seem to have evaporated.  She tells him of her
bereavement, her troubles.  She speaks sympathizingly
of his own, and brings in Lauraine's name so gently and
gradually that he cannot take alarm at it.  In the end he
accepts an invitation to her house.  And finds everything
so subdued, so decorous, in such perfect good taste, that
he thinks Lady Jean's widowhood has produced most
salutary effects.
</p>

<p>
In his present mood gaiety and fastness would have
jarred upon, and disgusted him.  As it is, all is toned down,
chastened, soothing, and in perfect taste.  He comes
again, and yet again.  Lady Jean keeps the foreigners,
and shady adventurers, and the Bohemian element carefully
out of his sight, and she herself treats him with
that consideration and deference always flattering to a
young man's feeling when displayed by a woman older
than himself, and still beautiful.  She mentions the
Vavasours casually, Lauraine as being immersed in
worldly gaieties.  Sir Francis as being abroad at Monte
Carlo.  The latter fact is true, he having proceeded there
in disgust at her obstinacy and coldness, and yet not
liking to break with her entirely, because she happens to
be the only woman of whom he has never tired.
</p>

<p>
The fortnight passes, and Keith still lingers.  Life
has no special object for him at present.  The spring
has turned cold and bleak, and the American tour may
await his own convenience.
</p>

<p>
One evening he comes to Lady Jean by special invitation.
There are a few people there; there is a little music, and
a little "play," not very high, not very alarming; but
Keith refuses it for a reason that no one there guesses.
Play had been a passion with him once.  Its dangerous
excitement had lured him into the most terrible scrape of
that "wild youth" to which Mrs. Douglas is so fond of
alluding.  Once free of that early trouble, he had
solemnly promised Lauraine never to touch card or dice again,
and he has kept his word.  Lady Jean does not press
him, though she looks surprised at his refusal.  She sits
with him in a dim corner of the room, and lures him on
to talk to her as he has done of late.
</p>

<p>
Watching them with anger and suspicion are two
fierce eyes, the eyes of a certain Count Karolyski, of whom
no one knows anything except that he is a Hungarian,
an expert card player, and a deadly shot.
</p>

<p>
The count is a devoted admirer of the Lady Jean's.  The
Count has been first in favour with her for months past,
and the Count looks with extreme wrath on this young
stripling who appears to have supplanted him, and who
is so serenely unconscious of the fact.
</p>

<p>
The refusal to play irritates him still more.  He knows
Keith is very rich, and had hoped to revenge his wounded
feelings by fleecing him with ease.  Keith has frustrated
this agreeable project and that fact rankles in the Count's
breast, beneath the expanse of white linen and glittering
orders that adorn it so lavishly.  The evening goes
on.  Wine is handed round and freely drunk.  A little
more noise and freedom than usual pervade the pretty,
gilded rooms.  Lady Jean gets somewhat uneasy.
She contrives to get rid of Keith; it does not suit her
purpose that he should think of her as anything but
highly decorous.  When he leaves and she comes back,
Count Karolyski throws down his cards, declaring he
is tired of play, and comes over to her side.
</p>

<p>
"You are cruel, madame," he says in French.  "You
have deserted us the whole evening."
</p>

<p>
She throws herself back in her chair with a little
laugh.  "Cruel!  You had better amusement than my
company."
</p>

<p>
"Amusement!  It is not that," he says, with an ardent
glance from his dark, flashing eyes.  "You are cold&mdash;fickle.
You are breaking my heart for the sake of that
American boy."
</p>

<p>
She interrupts him with pretended indignation.  "Count,
you forget yourself!  I permit no one to arraign my
actions."
</p>

<p>
"Far be it from me to do that.  I would not offend
you for worlds, madame; but I cannot refrain from
expressing my feelings when I see your old friends thrust
aside and forgotten, for sake of a beardless youth to
whom Fortune has been kinder than to us."
</p>

<p>
"I do not forget my friends," says Lady Jean, with a
quick glance; "and I am only civil to this boy because he
is friendless and alone, and I took pity on his solitude."
</p>

<p>
"Your pity, madame, may be a dangerous favour.
To those whom you really compassionate, exclusion
would be the greater mercy."
</p>

<p>
"Every one is not as foolish as yourself, Count," she
says with a soft glance.
</p>

<p>
It is pleasant to hear she is still beautiful&mdash;still can play
the part of an "apple of discord" to men.
</p>

<p>
"Because, perhaps, 'every one' has not found your
presence what I have found it."
</p>

<p>
"Hush!" she says softly; "you are talking folly,
and you know it.  The days are over when I believed in
compliments."
</p>

<p>
"You do not suppose I am insulting you by anything so
commonplace?  Compliment is the language of fools
and flatterers.  I am speaking the plain unvarnished
truth."
</p>

<p>
"Truth!" and she laughs lightly; "who speaks the
truth now?  It is as old-fashioned a virtue as
honesty."
</p>

<p>
"Unless one finds it impossible to act indifference."
</p>

<p>
"Come, Count," she says good-humouredly, "we know
each other too well to talk in this strain.  We are all
<i>bons camarades</i> here; no sentiment, and no seriousness.
I gave you credit for more sense than to fear you would
break through the rule."
</p>

<p>
His brows contract with a sudden angry frown.
</p>

<p>
"You do not mean what you say!  A woman like
yourself cannot set bounds to a man's admiration, or check
his feelings by ridicule.  I have scoffed at sentiment all
my life as a thing fit only for boys and women.  But all
that I have hitherto disdained has amply revenged my
past indifference.  And you&mdash;you have not discouraged
me, madame?"
</p>

<p>
Her heart beats high.  A sudden warm colour comes
into her face beneath its delicate rouge; but not from
any gratification at the homage&mdash;not for any reason
that makes him interpret these signs as flattering to
himself.  Only because she sees herself a step further on
the road of her vengeance&mdash;only because triumph whispers
to her that the end is not far off.
</p>

<p>
She rises after those last words, laughing still.  "I
do not believe in love, monsieur, any more than yourself.
No one has been able to convert me.  To parody an old
saying, with me it is only a case of '<i>La reine s'amuse</i>.'"
</p>

<p>
"And is this boy only a plaything also?" he says, with
an angry sneer.
</p>

<p>
"Of course.  Is he not a charming one?" she says
with sudden gravity.  "So earnest and credulous; quite
refreshing.  We have so long passed that stage of life,
<i>nous autres</i>."
</p>

<p>
"With women like yourself for teachers is that a matter
of wonder, madame?"
</p>

<p>
"Now you are sarcastic, and that is horrid.  Why,
Count, I do believe you are jealous of my pretty boy!
I thought you were wiser than that."
</p>

<p>
And laughing her soft, amused laughter, she passes on
into the card-room, leaving him standing there with the
mellow lamplight on his dark, passionate face, and shining
in the lurid depths of his eyes.  At that moment he hates
her and himself, and hates tenfold more the man he has
chosen to consider as his rival.
</p>

<p>
It had been true, as he had said, that he had deemed
himself above all such weaknesses, until the fascination
of this woman had entered into his life and fired his soul
with a passion, sudden, wild, fierce, and absorbing even
as it was revengeful.  To win her he would have done
much.  He was not a poor man, though far from being
rich, as Lady Jean counted riches.  Still he was of good
birth, and boasted of pure Magyar descent, and had
noble and ancient estates in Hungary, and thought
himself no ill match for the daughter of a poor Irish Earl.
But that Lady Jean should encourage his homage and
then ridicule it, filled him with fierce anger.
</p>

<p>
He leaves her room that night with a cold farewell, and
for two days does not approach her at all.
</p>

<p>
Lady Jean is amused.  It is what she expected, and
she does not resent it.  She sees Keith daily now&mdash;in
fact, takes care that she shall see him, for she is not
desirous that he should escape her toils.
</p>

<p>
Against his judgment, against his better reason, Keith
Athelstone submits to her caprices and permits her to
draw him to her presence.  He is unfortunately in that
state of mind in which a man is easily influenced by a
woman if she is sympathetic, friendly, and appears
interested in him.  At present nothing seems of much
consequence or account.  The fierce suffering of the last
two years has been lulled into a sort of quiescence.  The
good resolutions formed during that period of languor
and convalescence have taken just sufficient root to
strengthen him as far as Lauraine is concerned, and
with that self-sacrifice they end.
</p>

<p>
Life looks very monotonous, very dreary at present,
and there is just a little fillip given to its monotony by
Lady Jean.  It is not that he likes her&mdash;it is not that
he respects her, but he drifts into a sort of intimacy before
he really knows it, and she is always at hand to sustain
her influence.  And it so happens that all this comes
to the ears of Lauraine, filtered through the letters of
mutual friends, put in as spice to various gossip detailed
to her from Paris.
</p>

<p>
At first she cannot believe it.  It seems too horrible;
but unfortunately a letter comes from Lady Etwynde,
radiant in the flush and glory of her matronly honours,
and revelling in Paris delights with her handsome
husband; and that letter mentions casually the same
thing.  "Keith Athelstone has been driving in the
Bois with Lady Jean;" "I have met Keith, and asked
him to dinner, but he excused himself on the plea of a
previous engagement with Lady Jean," etc., etc.
</p>

<p>
Lady Etwynde tells her this, thinking it may really
keep her from brooding over the idea that she has ruined
her young lover's life; but had she known the torture it
would have inflicted, she would have been silent on the
subject.
</p>

<p>
Lady Etwynde's idea of Keith Athelstone has always
been that he is selfish and inconsiderate, and that
Lauraine is quite thrown away upon him; she feels
convinced now of her own sagacity when she sees how
foolish is his conduct.  She herself takes no notice of
Lady Jean, and when Keith excuses himself to her on
the plea before mentioned, she feels disgusted and
annoyed, and tells her husband she will have nothing
more to say to the young man.  She would have been
civil to him for Lauraine's sake, but if he prefers Lady
Jean, why to Lady Jean let him go.
</p>

<p>
"I knew he would never be constant," she says
complainingly.  "Really, men are too horrible."
</p>

<p>
"With one exception," smiles Colonel Carlisle, looking
proudly at the bright, petulant face, that seems to have
regained all its old sparkling witchery and youthfulness
with the "old" happiness.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Cyril, there is no one like you!" she answers.
</p>

<p>
"My darling," he says.  "Every woman says that
of the man she loves, and every man of the woman.
I think you are hard upon poor Keith.  Fancy, to love
a woman with all one's heart and soul, and know she can
be nothing to one.  Ah heaven! how fatal a thing is
marriage sometimes&mdash;how <i>sure</i> one ought to be of
oneself before entering into a life-long union."
</p>

<p>
"<i>We</i> are sure!" she murmurs, softly nestling closer
in his arms, as they stand side by side in the twilight
shadows.
</p>

<p>
"Thank God, we are!" he says, with passionate
earnestness.  "But often and often I think, if it had
not been for the sins and follies of the past&mdash;for the wrong
and the suffering&mdash;our love would never have been as deep
and intense a thing as it is.  I shall never forget those
years, and how hopelessly our lives seemed severed&mdash;with
what reluctance I came home to England&mdash;how I
dreaded to hear you were another's&mdash;and then&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"After all I was your own," she whispers.
</p>

<p>
"And we are so happy," he resumes presently.
"Are we not, my queen of æsthetes?"
</p>

<p>
She laughs a little tremulously.  "Indeed, yes;
but I fear, dearest, the queen has sadly neglected her
subjects.  Women's missions are all very well until men
interfere with them.  Then there is a lamentable
failure of all the grand schemes and projects."
</p>

<p>
"A woman's first mission is to love her husband
and make his home a paradise," answers Colonel Carlisle.
"I am not great at poetry, as you know, but I own
to an admiration of those lines of Tennyson in 'The
Princess.'  You know them:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  For woman is not undevelopt man,<br>
  But diverse; could we make her as the man<br>
  Sweet Love were slain; his dearest bond is this,<br>
  Not like to like, but like in difference.<br>
  Yet in the long years liker must they grow&mdash;<br>
  The man be more of woman, she of man.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br>
  Till at the last she sets herself to man,<br>
  Like perfect music unto noble words."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Yes," she says.  "They are very true, although a
man wrote them."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you believe our sex understands yours,
then?" he asks teasingly.
</p>

<p>
"No; I do not," she says decidedly.  "I think no
man yet ever quite comprehended a woman's nature,
any more, perhaps, than we comprehend a man's.
I think that is how we so often mistake and misjudge
each other.  We expect a man to act as we would act,
and he expects us to act as he would; and that can
never be.  Another thing: we have such quick instincts,
and are governed so often by sympathy or antipathy;
you are slow in your judgment, and <i>reason</i> where we act."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he answers thoughtfully; "but contrast
is the salt of life, my darling.  We should not find any
attraction in each other if we were quite alike, and
regulated our lives and actions on the same principles.
But to return to our subject.  I am certain Lady Jean
is up to some mischief, and I would give anything in
the world to get Keith Athelstone away from her
influence.  What <i>can</i> possess him to be always there?"
</p>

<p>
"Not always, dear," says his wife rebukingly.
"Three times within a fortnight.  I cannot understand
it myself.  I should like to give him a hint, but I am
afraid.  He might take offence, and I know what men
are.  Warn them against a woman, and they immediately
run after her; try to turn them from a purpose,
and they throw themselves heart and soul into it."
</p>

<p>
"You should treat them as the Irishman did his
pigs&mdash;drive them one way and turn their heads
another," laughs Colonel Carlisle.  "But you surely don't
imagine he cares about Lady Jean?"
</p>

<p>
"No; I give him credit for better sense.  But she is
a dangerous woman, and I am certain has some
purpose in view.  I know she hates Lauraine; I am
equally certain that she knows of Keith's infatuation for
her, and I feel convinced she is trying to work some
mischief.  You remember her plot about getting him
to Falcon's Chase?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  That was a piece of devilry, and no mistake.
I have thought more of the young fellow since his
refusal than ever I did before."
</p>

<p>
"Keith is a strange character," says Lady Etwynde;
"so headstrong and passionate, yet so loving and true;
so wild, and yet so easily controlled; so selfish, and
yet so weak.  Lauraine has a great influence over
him&mdash;more than any one else has, I think.  I believe when
once she made him see things in their true light, once
she showed him that the love that would dishonour
a woman is the last love worthy of her acceptance, he
would turn from what even seemed her own tempting.
But he must have known it could not be that."
</p>

<p>
"Lauraine is a good, true woman, though she has
made a fatal mistake in life, and now it is too late to
remedy it," says the Colonel regretfully.  "What sad
words those are, 'too late!'  Just to have missed all
that makes life desirable, just to meet and love, and
find that Fate has placed an impassable barrier between
you and that love.  Ah, me!"
</p>

<p>
"Don't sigh!" whispers his wife tenderly.  "Our
'too late' was just in time after all."
</p>

<p>
"Thank God for that!"
</p>

<p>
"I do," she answers fervently.  "But how my own
happiness makes me regret her loss!  I never thought
I could love any woman so dearly as I love Lauraine;
and I feel, oh! so sorry for her now!"
</p>

<p>
"So do I&mdash;for Keith."
</p>

<p>
"And you think we can do nothing?"
</p>

<p>
"I fear not.  It is a delicate matter.  He may be
only striving for forgetfulness after all.  Men do foolish
and desperate things sometimes for love's sake."
</p>

<p>
"That is one of the things we women who love you
can't understand," says Lady Etwynde.  "To us
those excesses to which we are accused of driving you
seem degrading and contemptible.  We can only excuse
sins that are not against ourselves, I suppose."
</p>

<p>
"Doubtless it looks cowardly," says her husband,
"to fling away our self-respect because something has
not been as we wished it; but then that something
is worth everything else in the world, or we think so, and
losing it, all else seems of no account."
</p>

<p>
"In that respect we set you an example, do we not?"
laughs his wife.  "We don't go to perdition because we
are disappointed in love."
</p>

<p>
"Because your natures are so different.  The same
rule cannot apply to a man and a woman.  I thought
we had agreed on that before," says Colonel Carlisle.
</p>

<p>
"So we had.  Instance Keith and Lauraine."
</p>

<p>
"And my lady and&mdash;myself."
</p>

<p>
And he bends down and kisses the sweet red lips.
</p>

<p>
That closes the argument.  They forget all about
Keith and Lauraine; they talk now of their own love,
and of each other.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXII
</h3>

<p>
It is a week later.  Lady Etwynde and her husband
have left Paris and gone back to the æsthetic mansion
in Kensington.  They have decided on living there
still.  To Lady Etwynde it is endeared by many
memories and associations, and her husband is content
with whatever pleases her.  Lady Jean is still in the
gay city, and so is Keith Athelstone.
</p>

<p>
"How the affair drags!" murmurs the Lady Jean to
herself one evening as she is making her toilette.
"Karolyski is persevering, I can see; but Keith&mdash;he is quite
too stupid.  I must try and hasten the <i>dénouement</i>.
Besides, Frank comes back in a few days, and I don't
want <i>him</i> to suspect.  Could I bring matters to an issue
to-night, I wonder?"
</p>

<p>
She looks at herself in the glass, and a flush of
triumph rises to her cheek.  She looks supremely
handsome in a dress of black satin, with judicious touches
of white lace and white flowers; and as she sweeps into
her rooms and sees Keith's involuntary glance of
admiration, she feels a little thrill of triumph.
</p>

<p>
As the evening goes on, as her guests assemble, she
contrives that Keith Athelstone should be always by
her side, and though the scowling face of Count
Karolyski is frequently turned towards her, she is by no
means intimidated.  He and Keith are mutually
antagonistic to each other, and to-night the Count's manner
is almost insulting.
</p>

<p>
Again, the question of play is mooted, and again he
taunts Keith with his care of his dollars.  The evening
is very warm, and the young fellow has drunk more
wine than he usually does, and Lady Jean has taken
care that it is wine both strong and exciting.
</p>

<p>
At the Count's veiled sneers he loses his temper&mdash;never
a very forbearing one&mdash;and, forgetful of promises
and resolutions, sits down at the table.
</p>

<p>
The stakes grow higher; he is winning fast.  Again
and again he is victor and again and again does the
money of the Count flow into his keeping.  Lady Jean
comes near him and leans against his chair.  Her
perfumed hair almost sweeps his cheek.  As he glances
up he meets all the dark intensity and lustre of her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"You are wonderfully fortunate in&mdash;everything,"
she says, smiling; and the Count glances up and crushes
back an oath between his set teeth.  Then quite
suddenly, and with the most serene innocence, Lady Jean
stoops and picks up a card by Keith's side.  "You have
dropped this," she says, and lays it on the table.
</p>

<p>
"The ace of spades&mdash;you have already played that,
monsieur!" says Count Karolyski.
</p>

<p>
"It cannot be mine, then," says Keith quietly.
</p>

<p>
The Count throws his cards contemptuously on the
table.
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur's luck may be wonderful, but with double
aces in his hand it is not so remarkable after all!"
</p>

<p>
Keith starts up&mdash;his hot young blood aflame: "What
do you mean&mdash;do you dare insinuate&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The Count's laugh falls across the horrified silence of
the guests as they draw near.
</p>

<p>
"Insinuate?  No, monsieur&mdash;it is for you to explain,
I think."
</p>

<p>
"I have nothing to explain," says Keith proudly.
"There is no proof that that card belonged to me.  If
you doubt my word, my honour, I am perfectly willing
to answer for both."
</p>

<p>
"Hush! hush! what are you saying," cries Lady Jean,
horrified.  "Of course it is a mistake.  Mr. Athelstone,
pray be calm."
</p>

<p>
Calm!  The hot blood is rushing through Keith's
veins&mdash;his eyes have their worst and most passionate
light.  "Your friend has thought fit to insult me,
madame," he says.  "I demand an apology or&mdash;satisfaction."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Pardieu</i>, monsieur!" laughs the Count, in his
most insulting manner.  "I am sorry I cannot answer
your first demand; as to the other&mdash;I am at your
service."
</p>

<p>
There is an instant's silence.  Women with blanched
faces, men with surprise and embarrassment, look on
these two who face each other&mdash;on the tall, slight figure
with its dauntless grace of bearing, on the blue eyes
flaming with anger and defiance; and then on the cruel,
smiling lips, and calm, dark face of the Hungarian.
</p>

<p>
Count Karolyski turns, says a few words to a man
near by, and then, with a bow, leaves the room.
</p>

<p>
Keith turns to Lady Jean.  "I regret that such a
scene should have happened in your house," he says,
calming his voice by a violent effort.  "You will excuse
my withdrawing now, madam?"  She has grown very
pale.  As he quits the salon she follows him.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Athelstone, do not proceed to extremities.  The
Count is a deadly shot.  He has fought more duels
than I could tell you&mdash;and you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Do you fancy I am afraid?" interrupts Keith,
turning his flashing eyes upon her face.  "Or that I
value my life so much, I would try to save it even for less
cause?  No; let him do his worst.  An insult like
that&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It was shameful, I know," says Lady Jean.  "But
still, you might leave Paris&mdash;you might&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"For what do you take me?" interrupts Keith
passionately.  "Do you think I am a coward?"
</p>

<p>
"No; oh, no," she murmurs.  "Only you are so
young, and life is all before you.  Why should you
forfeit love, happiness, all that may be in store, just for
a fancied insult that has questioned your honour?"
</p>

<p>
Keith looks at her searchingly.  The old vague
distrust of this woman is at work within his heart.  He
answers her very coldly.
</p>

<p>
"It <i>is</i> my honour I avenge.  I do not fancy
even you, as a woman, could counsel the acceptance of
such an insult as your friend has thought fit to put upon
me."  And with a bow he leaves her presence.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap33"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXIII
</h3>

<p>
An hour later.  Lady Jean sits alone in her boudoir.
Her guests have all gone.  A flush of excitement burns
on her cheek, her eyes look triumphant.
</p>

<p>
"Victory at last!" she murmurs to herself.  "When
she hears he is dead, and has met his death through my
instrumentality, I think she will know that I too can
avenge insult.  I have taken her husband and her lover
from her.  I said my hour would come.  It has come."
</p>

<p>
There is a stir, a noise of footsteps without.  The
door is thrust hurriedly open, and Count Karolyski
comes in.  Involuntarily Lady Jean rises.  She is
annoyed and troubled, and a little afraid.
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur, you know I do not receive at this hour."
</p>

<p>
"So your people told me, but my business pleads an
excuse.  I will not detain you long, madame.  I have
come to say I will spare your&mdash;lover&mdash;on one condition."
</p>

<p>
"I do not understand you," falters Lady Jean, turning
very pale.  He smiles his cold and evil smile.
</p>

<p>
"No?  Well, I will put it more plainly.  I will
retract my words.  This duel shall not take place if you
will be my wife."
</p>

<p>
She turns on him, angry and amazed.  "Monsieur,
you do me much honour.  But what I have refused to
love, I will scarcely yield to intimidation!"
</p>

<p>
He draws his breath sharply.
</p>

<p>
"Stay; listen to me.  Take heed before you refuse.
I have told you I have scoffed at love all my life till
you taught me to recant my error.  A man at my age
does not love lightly, nor is he easily turned from his
purpose.  To win you I would do anything&mdash;to lose
you drives me desperate.  If you refuse my prayer
to-night, your boy-lover shall never see your face again.
I swear it, and my oath is no less fatal than my hand
can be."
</p>

<p>
She turns aside; there is a smile of triumph on her
lips.  Has she fooled him so well that he actually
believes Keith Athelstone is his rival?
</p>

<p>
As she stands there, silent and thoughtful, a servant
knocks at the door and enters with a telegram.
</p>

<p>
She hastily seizes it and reads the contents, and all
the blood seems to forsake her face.  Trembling, she
sinks into a chair.
</p>

<p>
"If all should be lost even now?" she thinks,
and her eyes turn in momentary appeal to the stern.
cold face of the Count.  "I&mdash;I will think of what you
have said," she falters.  "But, believe me, you are
wrong when you think Keith Athelstone is anything to
me.  He is not; he never will be.  As for his life I
would not spare it if I could."
</p>

<p>
"What?" he cries, amazed.
</p>

<p>
"He&mdash;he has insulted me," stammers Lady Jean.
"I cannot tell you&mdash;I cannot explain; only if you love
me you will avenge me&mdash;not by his death, that I would
not say .... I wish you to wound him, and in such a
manner that the issue may be fatal&mdash;or otherwise&mdash;but
in any case that it may be uncertain enough to
allow of a messenger being sent to England to&mdash;a&mdash;a
friend of his.  Do you understand?"
</p>

<p>
"That I am to be a tool for you?  Perfectly, madame.
And my reward?"
</p>

<p>
"You shall ask for it when you have done my bidding,"
she murmurs softly, and holds out her hand for
the clasp of that one whose stains of blood-guiltiness
are to receive yet another addition, at her bidding.
</p>

<p>
He takes hers, and bends down and presses his lips
upon it fervently.  "I will do your will," he says;
"he shall live to suffer.  But, madame, remember, I
am no fool to be trifled with.  If you fail in your
part of the bargain it will be at your own peril.
Neither man nor woman has ever baulked me of my will,
who has not lived to rue it.  You may have fooled a
score of men, but you shall not fool me!  Love like mine
may be play to rouse, but it is death when roused."
</p>

<p>
She looks him calmly in the face.  "I have no
intention of deceiving you.  Promise me that Keith
Athelstone shall have but a few days' life left&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Her glance promises the rest.  It has all the intoxication,
the responsive meaning, that can inflame men's
passions&mdash;that has ever swayed them to her will.  It
sways him now.
</p>

<p>
He draws her to his heart with a fierce and sudden
tenderness, and she lets his lips rest unrebuked upon
her own.  "I promise," he murmurs; and she knows
he means it.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The telegram that has reached Lady Jean has been
despatched from Monte Carlo.  It contains these lines:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"<i>Sir Francis Vavasour lies here dangerously ill&mdash;it is
feared with typhoid fever.  He asks constantly for you.
Come at once.</i>"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
When Lady Jean is once more alone she reads the
message with a contemptuous laugh.
</p>

<p>
"He must be mad," she says.  "I to run the risk of
infection&mdash;I to turn sick-nurse!  I to run the gauntlet of
scandal and discussion for&mdash;him!  Pshaw! if he wants
a ministering angel, let him send to Lauraine.  It is her
<i>metier</i>, not mine."  Then she goes to her writing-table
and takes pen and ink and writes these lines:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Your husband is dangerously ill.  The enclosed
telegram will explain.  Keith Athelstone was severely
wounded in a duel fought in Paris this evening, and he
has only a few days to live.  If you wish to see him
alive come at once.  He is at Lady Jean Salomans'
house, No. 13, Rue Victoire Paris."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
This letter she seals and addresses and despatches
immediately.  Then, with that same light of triumph
in her eyes, that same relentless and unsparing hate in
her heart, she goes to her room and to rest.
</p>

<p>
No ill dreams disturb her&mdash;no sleepless hours of weary
wakefulness.  She has never known remorse in all her
life, and in her ears the "still, small voice" of conscience
has long ceased to whisper.  And as her eyes close in
sleep to-night she only thinks: "Vengeance is mine!"
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXIV
</h3>

<p>
Alone in the dreary solitude of Falcon's Chase, Lauraine
receives that message from her enemy.  It is early
morning; the sun is shining, the birds in the forest
avenues are singing their gladdest and loudest welcome
to spring; she stands at the window of her morning-room
and reads those lines penned in the Rue Victoire,
and a great darkness seems to come over her.
</p>

<p>
All her energies seem paralysed; she cannot think,
cannot decide.  Her husband dangerously ill, alone in a
foreign land, deserted by the woman for whom he has
wronged his wife, and Keith&mdash;Keith dying.
</p>

<p>
The sunlight seems to blind her; the light of day is
cruel.  Her heart feels numbed and dead, and in her
brain a thousand hammers seem to beat, and through all
that numbness and discord one thought alone shapes
itself in stern and terrible distinctness.  One thought;
it is Duty!
</p>

<p>
He has neglected her, he has outraged her, he has
forfeited all honour and respect.  Yet none the less is he
her husband, none the less is he the father of her child.
</p>

<p>
Her child! who lay in her bosom, and smiled into her
eyes and made earth Paradise for just a little space!
</p>

<p>
But Keith?  Keith, whom she loves; Keith, whom
she has wronged; Keith dying, and she cannot be
near him, cannot meet once more the look of the "bad
blue eyes," cannot whisper peace or comfort to the
young and passion-wrecked soul!
</p>

<p>
Her heart feels breaking.  The awfulness of this
decision seems beyond her strength to make; and yet she
knows&mdash;she cannot but know&mdash;which is the right course,
because of its very hardness.
</p>

<p>
"I have sinned; I must suffer," she groans despairingly,
and then moves away with half-blind eyes, and
feels as if her heart must break at last.  How can she
live on and endure such misery?
</p>

<p>
In an hour her preparations are complete, and she
starts for London.  A thought strikes her on her way.
At the first available station she gets out and sends a
telegram to Lady Etwynde, bidding her meet her at the
London terminus.  At the terminus her friend is
waiting and Colonel Carlisle also.  In a few hurried, broken
words Lauraine tells them all.
</p>

<p>
"And you are actually going to <i>him</i>!" cried Lady
Etwynde, amazed.
</p>

<p>
"I must; it is what I ought to do," falters Lauraine
piteously.  "I cannot leave him to die there alone
uncared for.  After all, he is my husband."
</p>

<p>
"You are right!" exclaims Lady Etwynde hurriedly.
"But a thought strikes me.  I&mdash;will go to Paris
and see Keith Athelstone.  You will let me, will you
not, Cyril?  Perhaps, after all, that fiend is lying."
</p>

<p>
Lauraine looks at her with unspeakable gratitude.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, if you would&mdash;if only you would!" she cries
passionately.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly we will!" exclaims Colonel Carlisle.
"Etwynde is quite right.  And I do not see why we
shouldn't all go as far as Paris together.  We have two
hours to spare.  Time enough to get what we want&mdash;money
and wraps.  All the rest we can get in Paris."
</p>

<p>
So it is hurriedly arranged, and the night express sees
them all <i>en route</i> for the French capital, the Colonel
and his wife doing their best to console and cheer
Lauraine, whose utter prostration and despair alarm them.
</p>

<p>
At Paris, Colonel Carlisle decides that she is really in
no fit condition to travel alone; and having seen his
wife fairly started for the address Lady Jean has given,
he takes charge of Lauraine, and goes on with her to the
Riviera.  When the long, fatiguing journey is over, and
they reach Monte Carlo, they find Sir Francis even worse
than the telegram had led them to imagine.  Lauraine
will not hear of Colonel Carlisle staying with her any
longer.  The fever must take its course; there is nothing
but careful nursing and watchfulness to be exercised,
and so she sends him back to Paris, and takes up her
station by the bedside of the man who has wronged
and outraged her so often&mdash;whose fretful moans even
now are all for that other woman.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Soeur de Charité</i> watching beside him looks up
in surprise as the slight young figure and beautiful face
bend over the unconscious man.
</p>

<p>
"It is madame&mdash;for whom he has been always asking?"
she asks hesitatingly.
</p>

<p>
Lauraine looks gravely up.
</p>

<p>
"I am his wife," she says simply.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Day after day passes wearily, slowly by.  Then comes
a letter from Lady Etwynde.
</p>

<p>
"It is all true," she writes; "Keith has been shot,
and all for some disgraceful scrape in which that woman
is mixed up.  But he is not at her house; he is in his own,
and Lady Jean has gone off with the man.  Every one
is talking of it.  Keith is in the utmost danger; but if
skill and care can do anything, I do not despair of him
yet.  The shot was within a hair's-breadth of piercing
his left lung.  He knows me, and I whispered to him
I was here by your desire.  You should have seen the
look in the boy's eyes: I feel so sorry for him; he is so
young, and he lies there in this awful state, and I know
his heart is aching for sight of you.  Lauraine, I see
that woman's scheme now.  She wanted you to make
a false step, one that would have ruined you for
ever.  Had you left your husband's house to come to
Keith it would have looked as if you had fled to your
lover.  Sir Francis would have been justified in doing
anything.  But how you had the courage, the self-denial,
to act as you have done puzzles me.  I could not have
believed it, though I thought I knew you so well.  But,
as I have told you before, hard as duty is, it brings its own
reward, and God will surely bless you with peace at last."
</p>

<p>
Lauraine reads the letter with streaming eyes, sitting
there beside her husband's couch.  Her heart is wrung
with agony, her eyes are full of anguish unutterable.
</p>

<p>
"Duty," she sighs.  "Ah, what a poor cold thing duty
looks," and she falls on her knees and prays for the young
life she loves, and for that other life trembling now in
the balance.  As she rises from her knees her husband
turns wearily on his pillow.  His eyes unclose, and with
a faint gleam of consciousness look at her.
</p>

<p>
"Lauraine!" he murmurs.
</p>

<p>
She leans over him, and touches his fevered hands.
"Yes; it is I," she says.
</p>

<p>
"You&mdash;and here; where&mdash;where&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He can say no more.  She stays him with a hasty
gesture.  "You must not talk, it is forbidden.  It is
enough that I heard you were ill&mdash;that I came."
</p>

<p>
"And she&mdash;Jean?"
</p>

<p>
A flush comes to Lauraine's pale cheeks; her eyes
grow dark and indignant.  "She!  Did you actually
suppose she would risk her convenience or comfort
for the sake of any human being?  She has found other
consolation."  He tries to spring up, but weakness
overpowers him.  "The curse of hell be upon her&mdash;fiend,
she-devil, temptress!" and then once again the ravings
of delirium crowd his brain, and he knows nothing
of her who is beside him.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It is a terrible time for Lauraine.  She takes scarcely
food or rest.  She tends and watches the sick man
with untiring patience; all the more stern is she in her
task of self-denial because she knows it is a task, because
she will not spare herself one iota of the pain and
weariness that her labours demand.  The physicians praise
her devotion, and in his lucid moments the sick man
murmurs blessings on her, and utters such vows of
penitence and remorse as might gladden the heart of any
wife whose love and patience had reclaimed her husband
from his errors.  But they do not gladden Lauraine.
</p>

<p>
The weary burden presses more heavily; the iron
enters more deeply into her soul.  But she has resolved
to go through with her task, and she dares not count the
cost.
</p>

<p>
"He is better," say the physicians.  "He will live."
</p>

<p>
The news comes to her, and she is silent, then sinks
on her knees and hides her face from sight.  They think
she is overpowered with emotion, and go softly away
and leave her&mdash;leave her fighting out a weary battle,
sick at heart with shame that in her mind is no gladness,
only a duller, sadder despair.

CHAPTER XXXV
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No man sees<br>
  Beyond the gods and fate.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It is night, and in the sick-room all is hushed and still.
</p>

<p>
Lauraine, in her soft grey dress is sitting beside the
bed.  She is alone; the first three hours are her watch.
She thinks her husband is asleep&mdash;he lies so still, and
his eyes are closed.  She looks white and frail as a broken
lily.  Her head leans on her hands; the whole expression
of her face is one so sad, so heart-crushed, that it might
have made any one who loved her weep to read it.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly she looks at the quiet figure.  His eyes are
fixed on her face.  He has been watching her.
</p>

<p>
"Will you ever forgive me, Lauraine?" he says
faintly.  "I have been such a brute, and you&mdash;I
always said you were too good a woman.  It must have
needed an angel's heart to do what you have done."
</p>

<p>
"It was nothing&mdash;nothing," she says hurriedly.
"Sick-nursing was always my <i>forte</i>, you know.  Besides,
I only did my duty."
</p>

<p>
"Your duty!" he echoes, with something of the old
bitterness.  "It is well for you that you have so strong
a sense of it.  I have forgotten what the word means."
</p>

<p>
She is silent.  There is a long pause.  After a while
he speaks again.
</p>

<p>
"I have ruined your life, I know, and now it is too
late&mdash;too late to make amends.  Still, the best amends I
could make would be to free you from myself&mdash;and
that will soon be the case, Lauraine.  Hush!  Do you
suppose I believe what those fools said to-day&mdash;that
a man cannot tell when his end is near?  I shall not
plague you any longer&mdash;and you may be happy&mdash;yet."
</p>

<p>
"Don't say that," entreats Lauraine, kneeling beside
him, and taking the hand he extends so feebly.  "There
is every hope now; the worst is over.  You are only
weak, and that makes you dispirited about yourself."
</p>

<p>
He shakes his head.  "I know; I know.  Promise
me one thing.  You will not leave me; you will stay with
me to the end.  Last night I had a dream.  I thought
I was alone&mdash;all alone, and it was all black and dark,
and you had left me; and look where I would there were
fiends grinning at me, and all my past sins seemed a
burning fire upon my soul.  It was horrible.  Bad as I
am, and have been, say you won't forsake me till the end,
Lauraine; it is some comfort to have a good woman's
prayers.  I can feel that at last."
</p>

<p>
"I will not leave you, do not fear," Lauraine assures
him earnestly.
</p>

<p>
"But promise, child," he says restlessly, "promise."
</p>

<p>
And with a great wonder, but most gentle earnestness,
she promises.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Another hour.
</p>

<p>
She kneels there still.  He has fallen into a fitful doze,
from which he starts from time to time, to be reassured
only by the pressure of her hand&mdash;murmur from her lips.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Another hour.
</p>

<p>
The darkness of the night creeps on, slowly, wearily
enough.  The prayers her lips have framed are hushed
now.  He sleeps more calmly, more tranquilly, than he
has done yet.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Another hour.
</p>

<p>
The Sister who relieves her comes softly in.  She holds
something in her hand, which she gives to Lauraine.
</p>

<p>
For a second's space, as her eyes rest on the little
yellow paper, Lauraine grows faint with a great and
unaccountable dread.  Then she opens the envelope
and reads the message within.
</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<p>
"They say there is no hope.  If you can by any means
leave Sir Francis, do come here.  His one prayer is for
a sight of you before he dies."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The paper flutters from her hand.  She does not speak
or move, only stands there as if frozen to stone.
</p>

<p>
"I must go, I must go!" she says in her heart.
"Dying!  Oh, my love, my love!  Are you leaving
me thus?  Will God not have pity on you?"
</p>

<p>
Mechanically, like one in a dream, she moves away;
she scarcely knows whither she is going.  Only that one
impulse is in her mind&mdash;to fly to Keith's side at last;
to bid him farewell on earth as never had she thought to
bid it; to kiss for the last time those eyes that she
seemed to see before her even now&mdash;tender, triumphant,
agonized, beseeching, as had been his words!
</p>

<p>
As her hand is on the door a faint sound reaches her
ears, and pierces through the mists that cloud her brain
as though its feeble utterance were a trumpet's blast.
It is her husband's voice.
</p>

<p>
"Lauraine," he sighs, and moves restlessly in his sleep.
She stands there like one stunned.  "Oh, God!" she
murmurs within herself, "<i>my promise!</i>"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Alone in her own room Lauraine sits in a sort of stupor,
merciful in its dull pain, since it renders all thought
powerless for the time being.
</p>

<p>
Her husband has need of her.  She has promised to
stay with him, and she must keep her word.  No past
sins or errors of his should be the measure of her duty,
so she had felt; and now her word is given, and Keith's
dying eyes seem to summon her across the weary
distance that separates them, and she dares not go.
</p>

<p>
It is but a few moments since she has left her husband's
side, but the Sister comes to her now to entreat her to
return.  Sir Francis is asking for her.  She rises
mechanically, and goes back to the sick-room.  The gaunt
face, the eager eyes are turned towards the door.
</p>

<p>
"You promised not to leave me," he whispers, faintly,
and Lauraine cannot find it in her heart to tell him that
she needs rest, that she is worn and spent with long
hours of anxiety and suspense.
</p>

<p>
"Come here&mdash;sit down&mdash;so&mdash;close to me," he
continues brokenly.  "Tell her to go.  I must speak to
you alone."  Lauraine turns and makes a sign to the
Sister.  She leaves the room at once.
</p>

<p>
Then Sir Francis turns and holds out in his hand
the little paper that had held for her a message of eternal
woe.  "Is&mdash;is it true?"
</p>

<p>
She bows her head.  Words will not come.
</p>

<p>
"You dropped it.  I asked the woman to give it me,"
says her husband.  "Lauraine, don't stay here for&mdash;for
my sake; if it will comfort you or&mdash;him&mdash;go."
</p>

<p>
A flush comes over the white, sad face, then fades
and dies away.  "My place is by you," she answers.
</p>

<p>
"By me?" he echoes bitterly.  "By the wretch
whose selfishness and brutality have ruined your life?
My God!"
</p>

<p>
There is a long silence.  He takes her hands and looks
at her.  "Even my death cannot atone now.  I thought
it might.  It is true, is it not?  You do&mdash;love&mdash;him?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she answers simply.  "But why speak of
that now?  The past is over and done with.  You told
me once I was only strong because I had been untempted.
Ah! how little you knew!"
</p>

<p>
"That he should die," mutters Sir Francis.
"Young&mdash;brave&mdash;hopeful.  For me&mdash;it is no matter.  How is
it, Lauraine?  Tell me all!"
</p>

<p>
"He was shot," she says, marvelling how she can
speak so calmly&mdash;how dull and far away seems everything
in and out of her life.  "In Paris.  Some dispute
arose between him and&mdash;and a friend of Lady Jean
Salomans'.  They met in the Bois, and Keith was
dangerously wounded.  They say now there is&mdash;no hope."
</p>

<p>
Oh, the weariness of the voice, the anguish of the
white, sad face.
</p>

<p>
"She," mutters Sir Francis.  "Was this her
vengeance?"  Then he is silent again.
</p>

<p>
"Lauraine, go to Keith Athelstone; I command you.
If there is time&mdash;if you see him alive tell him I bade you
go&mdash;tell him I ask his pardon for the wrong I have
done him.  Go, child; why do you linger here&mdash;every
moment is precious.  Do you think I am so altogether
selfish that I cannot see how you suffer&mdash;cannot feel
all you have done&mdash;for me?  Go."
</p>

<p>
"But you," she says hesitatingly; "you need me;
you wished me to stay."
</p>

<p>
"I am better.  I feel stronger," he says, with brave
effort.  "And the worst is over; you need not fear for
me.  I have wronged you enough.  Let me feel I have
tried to do one unselfish action&mdash;even at the last."
</p>

<p>
She looks at his face&mdash;at the drawn, sharpened
features, the sunken eyes, the hollow cheeks.  A sudden
fear and reproach smite her.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot leave you," she says, with a burst of tears.
"We have been most unhappy, I know, but you are my
husband&mdash;my child's father."
</p>

<p>
"And the man for whom you have no love.  Child! do
not waste time in folly.  At a moment like this we see
things as they are&mdash;naked, bare, undisguised.  Take
my message to him, and comfort him with your presence.
It is the one thing I can do for you both; and I do it
with all my heart.  Spare no expense&mdash;gold will speed
your journey, and I&mdash;I shall wait here till I know&mdash;he
has forgiven."
</p>

<p>
Still she hesitates.  Still she feels as if she were in
some way wronging the man to whom duty binds
her, for sake of the man she loves.  He grows impatient.
</p>

<p>
"For me the worst is past.  I shall do very well now.
Are you scrupulous as to that?&mdash;know no fear.  You
have been obedient in all things that caused you
suffering.  Can you not be it for one thing that you
desire?  Must I storm&mdash;insist?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, hush," she says passionately; "it is so hard&mdash;if
only I knew&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"You do know.  I bid you go, and that without
an evil thought&mdash;you have but to obey."
</p>

<p>
Then she leaves him.  He listens to the hurried
preparations.  A strange, feverish strength seems to have
come to him.  As he has said, it is the one really unselfish
action he has ever performed in his life.  For though
he has bidden her leave him, he is longing for her
presence.  He knows his own hours are numbered, despite
the hopes held out.  He knows that to have her with him
during the dreadful ordeal through which he has to pass
would be the only comfort that life holds.  He shudders
as he lies there face to face with death, as the cold
waters of the great river seem to flow on&mdash;on&mdash;up to his
very feet; and in that awful passage there will be no
voice to whisper comfort, no prayers from that low,
sweet woman's voice to tell of peace, of hope, of the
gates of mercy standing open yet, even to the greatest of
sinners.  He shudders, and the cold dews of anguish stand
upon his brow.  But he is strong still, strong enough to
hide the truth from her.  She comes to bid him farewell,
and he looks long and sorrowfully at the fair, sad
face.  How changed she is, how changed!
</p>

<p>
"You will kiss me&mdash;just once, bad as I am," he
whispers, and with the tears standing thick in her eyes
she bends down and for the first time in all their married
life kisses him of her own free will.
</p>

<p>
"God bless you," she murmurs fervently.
</p>

<p>
"Say you forgive," he entreats, laying his hand on hers.
</p>

<p>
"I have forgiven&mdash;long ago," she answers, and with
murmured words of hopefulness and trust, they part;
part to meet on this side of the grave never, never
more.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXVI
</h3>

<p>
Very feebly and faintly the pulse of life is flickering in
Keith Athelstone's frame.  Very despairingly does Lady
Etwynde watch beside him.
</p>

<p>
It is twelve hours since that last message went.
Twelve hours, and in every one of these has that same
question been on the dying lips&mdash;"Will she come?"
</p>

<p>
They cannot tell.  They can only hope.
</p>

<p>
At last he falls asleep, and Lady Etwynde sits there,
sad and anxious and full of grief for the two lives whose
short years have held such bitter suffering&mdash;before which
now stretches the gulf of an eternal parting.
</p>

<p>
The sky grows rosy with the dawn, the sunlight steals
in through the closed blinds, and plays about the quiet
room, and Lady Etwynde softly opens the window,
and the cool fresh air steals in, and its breath plays over
the pallid young face that lies on the pillows, looking
like sculptured marble.  Quite suddenly he lifts his
languid eyelids and looks eagerly, joyfully up.  "She
is coming!" he cries.  "I know it."
</p>

<p>
The hours pass on, but that inward conviction remains
unshaken.  Something&mdash;some mysterious prescience
for which he cannot account&mdash;tells him that his
darling will be by his side.  He is quite patient now,
and quite calm&mdash;calm with the fulness of a great
content.  The day passes on to noon and noon to
even-tide.  He asks no more that question: "Will she
come?"  He knows it is answered.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The door opens softly and without sound.  He is
lying with closed eyes&mdash;the hired nurse is by his side.
Lady Etwynde is not there.
</p>

<p>
Some one comes in and moves towards the bed, and
bends over the quiet figure.  How still he is; is it
sleep, or&mdash;&mdash;?
</p>

<p>
The lids, with their long, dark lashes, suddenly open
and looking back to her own with the old boyish, adoring
love that nothing can chill or change, are the "bad blue
eyes" of her girlhood's lover.
</p>

<p>
She sinks on her knees; she is trembling greatly;
she finds no words to say, but none are needed.
</p>

<p>
Pain, weakness, weariness, seem to flee away before
the magic of her presence; over the white face comes
such radiance and tenderness as never has she
seen.
</p>

<p>
"It is you.  I knew you would come, Lorry."
</p>

<p>
"My darling boy!" she half sobs, half sighs, and then
a great darkness sweeps over her like a cloud, and she
sees his face no more.
</p>

<p>
The nurse summons Lady Etwynde.  She is horrified
at this occurrence.  It will be so bad for her patient.
"The shock is enough to kill him"&mdash;so she murmurs
as they busy themselves with the unconscious woman.
</p>

<p>
Keith watches them quietly, not even anxious or
disturbed.  All his life seems to have become one great
calm now.
</p>

<p>
"Kill me&mdash;&mdash;" he says, as the nurse's words reach
him.  "She has given me life!"
</p>

<p>
And indeed it seems as if she had, for from that hour
slowly but surely he begins to mend.
</p>

<p>
The weakness and exhaustion against which his physicians
had battled, no longer hold his strength in their
control.  Hope, peace, joy have come to him with
Lauraine's presence, and with them comes also the
desire to live.
</p>

<p>
"It is wonderful!" say the doctors.
</p>

<p>
"It is wonderful!" echoes Lady Etwynde, standing
by Lauraine's side some two days later, and noting the
change that at last leaves room for hope.
</p>

<p>
The blue eyes look up to one face&mdash;the face that has
haunted his life, and seems to have called him back
across the border-land on which his feet have rested.
</p>

<p>
"It is not wonderful," they seem to say, "it is only&mdash;love."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXVII
</h3>

<p>
"Dear, dear!  Now, only <i>do</i> tell!" exclaims Mrs. Bradshaw
Woollffe, in the solemn conclave of a feminine
gathering at the commencement of the London season.
"You ought to know, Mrs. Douglas.  Is your daughter
really going to marry Keith Athelstone after all?"
</p>

<p>
"After all!" echoes Mrs. Douglas.  "All what!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I guess you know pretty well what people
said two seasons ago.  But to think things should turn
out like this&mdash;quite a romance!  Only to think of it!"
</p>

<p>
"It is not so unnatural," says Mrs. Douglas loftily.
"Mr. Athelstone was always deeply attached to my
daughter, and, in fact, came home from America with
the intention of proposing.  But he was just too late.
My dear girl had accepted Sir Francis Vavasour."
</p>

<p>
"Is that so?  Well, I've heard another shaped tale
about that.  Anyhow, it seems Sir Francis was a brute
to her, and she&mdash;well, any one who knows Lauraine,
knows she's got real downright good stuff in her; and
as for Vavasour&mdash;isn't there one of your national poets
says: 'Nothing in his life became him like his leaving
it'?  That's just about his sort for an epitaph, I should
say.  No offence, I hope, Mrs. Douglas, though he was
your son-in-law.  You know I always speak my mind
right plump out.  There's no nonsense about me."
</p>

<p>
"I am not in the least offended," says Mrs. Douglas
sweetly.  "All men have faults, and Sir Francis
Vavasour was certainly not as devoted a husband as my dear
child had reason to expect.  But you see she is rather
cold and prudish, and all that, and he&mdash;well, he had
been spoilt by society.  We must excuse him for being
a little wild, and really they got on very well together,
and nothing could exceed his kindness and generosity
to Lauraine.  And he has left her everything."
</p>

<p>
"And she's going to marry Keith Athelstone?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, her husband has been dead for nearly a year,
and dear Keith is so very delicate since that accident,
and he has been ordered to winter at Algiers, and
nothing will induce him to go unless Lauraine goes also."
</p>

<p>
"That was a queer thing too," says Mrs. Bradshaw
B. Woollffe eagerly.  "Never could make head or tail of it.
Lady Jean was kind of mixed up in that duel, wasn't she?"
</p>

<p>
"Really," says Mrs. Douglas, with her most stately air,
"I must decline to say anything about that woman.
Her conduct has been quite too disgraceful.  Quite."
</p>

<p>
"Her conduct was no better or worse, that I can see,
when her husband was alive," answers Mrs. Woollffe.
"She was always bad, though, of course, no one could
see it until Joel Salomans had lost all his money.
I've never heard a good word of her since."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Douglas looks uncomfortable.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, as long as society is not publicly outraged,
as long as there is some show of decency, it puts up with
a great deal; but when any one is imprudent enough
to over-step the boundary mark, that alters the case."
</p>

<p>
"Of course," agrees Mrs. Woollffe, with a smile.
"It's only natural to wink at what suits our convenience.
I wonder why Lady Jean has never come to London
again since she married that foreigner, Count&mdash;&mdash;what's
his name?"
</p>

<p>
"Count Karolyski.  I don't know, I'm sure, But I
think it is just as well.  No one in her old set could
possibly receive her."
</p>

<p>
"Well, your English society beats me!" exclaims
Mrs. Bradshaw B. Woollffe.  "Guess you're the
rummest lot of people on the face of creation.
What&mdash;you're not going?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I must.  It is Lady Etwynde Carlisle's day, you
know; and I want to look in and hear some later news
of my child.  She corresponds so constantly with her
friend.  Of course, it is only natural."
</p>

<p>
"Old cat," murmurs Mrs. Woollffe, as the satin skirts
trail away in the distance.  "You could not blackguard
your daughter enough once, and now it's 'dear child,'
and 'dear Keith.'  Ugh!  I've no patience with such
humbug.  Ah, there is Nan and her husband.  Nan,
my dear, such news.  Keith Athelstone is going to
marry, and whom do you think?"
</p>

<p>
"Lady Vavasour, of course," answers the young
Countess of Longleat quietly.
</p>

<p>
"Why, you knew!" exclaims Mrs. Bradshaw Woollffe,
disappointed.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't; I only guessed.  I always thought it
would come to that.  Poor Keith!"
</p>

<p>
She sighs, and the radiant eyes grow a little dim.
A vision of the handsome face and figure of the man who
had been her girlish hero rises suddenly before her;
in contrast to them she sees the red hair and burly frame
of her own lord and master.  "Well, fretting's no good,"
she says, with a little laugh at the contrast.  "I was
awfully fond of Keith, and I do hope he'll be happy at
last.  He's had a long spell of&mdash;the other thing."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
And meanwhile where is the prime mover in the plot
that was to ruin Lauraine's happiness&mdash;that was to
have been a scheme of vengeance perfect as woman's
malice and skill could make it?  The world of society,
of fashion&mdash;the world which she delights in, and has
delighted&mdash;knows Lady Jean no more.
</p>

<p>
If she had never met her master in all her life before,
she met him in the person of Count Karolyski.  He
was a stern tyrant and a jealous ruler.  Once his wife,
and once safe among the gloomy solitudes of his own
possessions in the Carpathian range, there was neither
peace nor liberty for the Lady Jean.
</p>

<p>
Passionate, exacting, cruel, domineering, this man,
who had for her an absorbing passion, but neither trust
nor belief, resolved that she should never escape his
keeping, let her chafe and fret as she would.
</p>

<p>
When she heard of Sir Francis Vavasour's death
she had congratulated herself on her prudent acceptance
of this other man, more especially as she knew that his
action had rid Lauraine of her lover, and poisoned all
the freedom of her sudden release.
</p>

<p>
But when in course of time she learnt of Keith's
recovery, her rage and fury knew no bounds.  Then,
for the first time as yet in their married life, she gave
her husband a specimen of her tigress temper; but then
also for the first, though not the last time, did she learn
that she had sold herself into a bondage from which
there was no escape, and, galled, fretted, half
broken-hearted, she found herself compelled to do his
bidding, and accept her present fate.
</p>

<p>
If Lauraine had been unhappy too, it would have
sweetened the gall and wormwood of her own lot;
but that her rival should now have peace and happiness,
and she herself sink to a life that was as dreary as a
captive's, was the crowning stab to her many wounds.
</p>

<p>
And yet, burn in anger, chafe in humiliation as she
might, there was no help for her and no possibility of
escape.  The violence of her tempestuous passions only
seemed to amuse him.  Tears and reproaches alike beat
against the stony calm and immovability of his nature,
as futile waves may lash a rock that has borne their fury
for centuries.
</p>

<p>
Do what she might, act as she pleased, one fact alone
showed itself to her.  She was a disappointed and helpless
woman, and she was in the power of a master against
whom it was useless to rebel.  The long dreary days
went by, empty as a rifled grave, cold with the chill of
an endless despair.
</p>

<p>
Such was her life; such would be her life for all the
future now.  Her soul might rebel as it would, and
her heart grow sick within her as the sullen shadows
of memory dogged her every footstep, but she was
powerless to evade or resent.  Her evil deeds had gained
now their own reward&mdash;the vengeance she had planned
for another had recoiled on her own head.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
And where are the two about whom so much gossip
is rife, concerning whom so many tongues are
wagging?
</p>

<p>
Have the sundered lives been joined at last?  Has
fate done its worst, and, wearied of spite, grown callous
now as to what may or may not ensue?
</p>

<p>
Two days after Lauraine had left him, Sir Francis
Vavasour died.  His presentiment had been true,
but his sacrifice had in some way softened the bitterness
of death.
</p>

<p>
Lauraine was smitten with terrible remorse.  It
seemed to her always as if she should have withstood
his wishes and remained by his side until the end.
</p>

<p>
Even her husband's dying words&mdash;the message
penned by his hand&mdash;failed to comfort her, and it
took all Lady Etwynde's persuasions, and all Colonel
Carlisle's strong common sense, and all Keith's tender
reproaches to lessen the sharpness of her own
self-accusation&mdash;to convince her that her fault, if fault it were,
deserved no such harsh condemnation as she feared.
</p>

<p>
A year has passed since freedom came to her&mdash;a
year so peaceful and so calm that sorrow and pain
and self-accusing seem lulled to rest, and once again
Keith whispers of happiness in store.
</p>

<p>
A year, and to-morrow she will wed her lover.
</p>

<p>
He kneels by her side in the summer moonlight&mdash;his
heart too full of rapture for words&mdash;his eyes resting
ever on her face with that adoration neither has wearied
of yet.
</p>

<p>
"You are happy&mdash;you are <i>sure</i> you are happy?"
he asks, as he has asked a thousand times before.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, yes," she sighs.  "Too happy almost, it seems

ago, dear when I was very wicked, very discontented,
very wretched."

"What was it?"

"That anthem from the 'Elijah': 'Trust in the Lord;
wait patiently for Him, and He will give thee thy heart's
desire.'"

"Can you ask?" she murmurs passionately; and
in the soft summer dusk he draws her arms about his
neck, and kisses the trembling lips.

"I can, I do.  Tell me," he says, with soft insistence.

"Just your own graceless self, Keith!"

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

provided that:

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
